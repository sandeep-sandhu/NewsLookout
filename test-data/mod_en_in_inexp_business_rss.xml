<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">LUCKNOW: President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday said he had never imagined that an ordinary village boy like him would have the honour of occupying the highest post in the country, and thanked the people of his birth place for this.</p>

<p>He was addressing a gathering at the Paraunkh village, which is his birthplace, in Kanpur Dehat district.</p>

<p>"I had never imagined even in my dreams that an ordinary village boy like me would have the honour of occupying the highest post in the country. But, our democratic system made this possible," Kovind said.</p>

<p>"Wherever I have reached today, the credit goes to the soil of this village, this region, and to your love and blessings," he said and also paid tributes to freedom fighters and makers of the Constitution.</p>

<p>"According to my family's 'sanskaar' (values), the oldest woman in the village is given the status of mother and the oldest man is given the status of father, irrespective of caste or community. Today, I feel happy that this tradition of giving respect to the elders in our family is still continuing," Kovind said.</p>

<p>He said that the scent of soil of the village and the memories of its residents always remain etched in his heart.</p>

<p>"For me Paraunkh is not only a village, it is my 'maatribhoomi' (motherland) from where I get inspiration to serve the country," Kovind said.</p>

<p>"This inspiration has made me reach from high court to the Supreme Court to the Rajya Sabha. From the Rajya Sabha, I moved to the Raj Bhavan and from there to the Rashtrapati Bhavan," the president said.</p>

<p>Kovind also recited a Sanskrit phrase to highlight the pride of 'janmabhoomi' (place of birth), and said, "The pride of a mother who gives birth (to a child) and the 'janmabhoomi' is greater than heaven.</p>

<p>" Kovind on Sunday morning reached Paraunkh village where he was welcomed by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said Vikas Rai, the PRO to SP Kanpur Dehat.</p>

<p>He took a round of the village along with Patel and Adityanath.</p>

<p>Kovind, along with his wife and daughter, also visited the Pathri Devi temple where they offered prayers.</p>]]></story>

<title>Rajnath Singh begins visit to Ladakh amid stalemate in disengagement process with China</title>

<description><![CDATA[In Leh, Singh interacted with senior elected representatives of Kargil, Leh and Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council with a focus on the overall development of the regions]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The dedication of Indian soldiers and veterans towards the country is an "exemplary example", Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Sunday soon after arriving in Ladakh on a three-day visit aimed at taking stock of India's military preparedness in the region in the face of a prolonged border row with China.</p>

<p>In Leh, Singh interacted with senior elected representatives of Kargil, Leh and Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council with a focus on the overall development of the regions, officials said.</p>

<p>The defence minister, accompanied by Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, also met a number of armed forces veterans and discussed issues relating to their welfare as well as national security.</p>

<p>"The dedication of our soldiers and veterans towards the country is an exemplary example.</p>

<p>I express my gratitude from the bottom of my heart to all," Singh said on the occasion.</p>

<p>"Our aim is that all of you should be taken care of in the same way you had taken care of the country's security.</p>

<p>Despite this, if you have any problems somewhere, then a helpline has been arranged for to address them," his office quoted him as saying.</p>

<p>Official sources said the defence minister will carry out a comprehensive review of India's operational readiness in eastern Ladakh amid a stalemate in the next stage of disengagement with China at several friction points.</p>

<p>His visit to the sensitive region comes two days after India and China held a fresh round of diplomatic talks to resolve the prolonged military standoff that began in early May last year.</p>

<p>The defence minister is scheduled to visit various key formations and high-altitude bases in the region to assess the ground realities as well as to boost the morale of the troops guarding the Line of Actual Control in a hostile environment.</p>

<p>It is Singh's first visit to eastern Ladakh after the Indian and Chinese militaries pulled back troops, tanks, infantry and other equipment from the Pangong lake areas in February as part of an agreement.</p>

<p>The disengagement process in the remaining friction points including Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang is deadlocked as China is reluctant to withdraw its troops from these areas.</p>

<p>At a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs on Friday, India and China agreed to hold the next round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points.</p>

<p>Singh's visit to the sensitive region comes amid fresh sparring between India and China over the standoff.</p>

<p>India on Thursday blamed China for the standoff saying its amassing of a large number of troops close to the border and attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo along the LAC last year were responsible for seriously disturbing peace and tranquillity in the region.</p>

<p>India's response came after China said its military deployment in the region is a normal defence arrangement aimed at "preventing and responding" to "encroachment and threat" on Chinese territory by India.</p>

<p>India and China were locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year.</p>

<p>However, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.</p>

<p>The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.</p>

<p>India has been particularly pressing for disengagement of troops in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.</p>

<p>According to military officials, each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control in the sensitive sector.</p>

<p>There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks.</p>

<p>Last month, Gen Naravane said that there can be no de-escalation without complete disengagement at all friction points in eastern Ladakh and that the Indian Army is prepared for all contingencies in the region.</p>

<p>The Army Chief also said that India is dealing with China in a "firm" and "non-escalatory" manner to ensure the sanctity of its claims in eastern Ladakh, and that it was even open to initiating confidence-building measures.</p>]]></story>

<title>To foster ease of land property registration, government plans to link e-courts with land records</title>
<author>PTI</author>

<description><![CDATA[The government feels that in the long run it will reduce dubious transactions, help in dispute containment and also reduce clogging of the court #39;s system.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: Seeking to help bonafide buyers know whether the land they plan to buy is under any legal dispute, the government plans to link e-courts with land records and registration database.</p>

<p>The government feels that in the long run it will reduce dubious transactions, help in dispute containment and also reduce clogging of the court's system.</p>

<p>The pilot project on linking of e-Court with land records and registration database has been successfully completed in Maharashtra along with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana and soon it will be launched across the country.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice in the Law Ministry has requested the registrars general of all the high courts to provide clearance to state governments to integrate land records and registration database with eCourts and National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) for speedy disposal of property disputes.</p>

<p>Eight high courts have so far responded.</p>

<p>These are Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh.</p>

<p>"In this regard, it will be appreciated if you could facilitate expeditious action at your end in providing the state government with necessary clearances for enabling the nationwide launch of linking of e-Court with land records and registration database as well as other tasks related to it," the Department of Justice letter sent in April this year said.</p>

<p>It observed that registering property in an easy and transparent manner is one of the parameters evaluated by the World Bank for assessing the performance of 190 global economies on the Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Index.</p>

<p>The Department of Land Resources (DoLR) is the nodal department responsible for registering property index and has earned only 3.</p>

<p>5 marks against a total weightage of 13 marks for quality of Land Administration Index, it noted.</p>

<p>"To foster ease of land property registration and creation of a conducive eco system, a committee was set up along with eCommittee of the Supreme Court for linking of eCourts with land records and registration database.</p>

<p>"The logic behind this is that if the legal status of any land/plot is properly captured and made available on the public domain, it would transparently guide a bonafide buyer while registering a sale deed as to whether the title of the subject land is disputed or not," the letter said.</p>

<p>The eCourts project is being implemented in district and subordinate courts of the country with an aim to provide designated services to litigants, lawyers and judiciary through universal computerisation of district and subordinate courts.</p>]]></story>

<title>Delta plus has more affinity for lung tissues in comparison to other COVID-19 strains: NTAGI chief</title>
<author>PTI</author>
<source>PTI</source>
<pubDate>Sunday, June 27, 2021 01:34 PM +0530</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[Till now, 51 cases of Delta Plus have been detected across 12 states, with Maharashtra reporting the maximum cases of this variant.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Delta plus variant of COVID-19 has greater affinity to lung tissues as compared to other strains but it does not mean that it will cause severe disease or is more transmissible, head of coronavirus working group NTAGI Dr N K Arora said.</p>

<p>A new viral variant of the coronavirus, Delta Plus, was identified on June 11.</p>

<p>It was recently classified as a variant of concern.</p>

<p>Till now, 51 cases of Delta Plus have been detected across 12 states, with Maharashtra reporting the maximum cases of this variant.</p>

<p>Talking about Delta plus, chairman of COVID-19 Working Group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) said it has been found that the variant has greater affinity to lung tissues as compared to other strains of coronavirus but clarified that it does not mean the Delta Plus variant will cause more severe disease or is more transmissible.</p>

<p>"Delta plus is having greater affinity to mucosal lining in the lungs, higher compared to other variants, but if it causes damage or not is not clear yet.</p>

<p>It also does not mean that this variant will cause more severe disease or it is more transmissible," Arora told PTI in an interview.</p>

<p>He said the impact of the Delta plus strain will become clear only as more cases are identified but it appears that the disease is generally mild in all those who have got either single or double dose of the vaccine.</p>

<p>"We need to keep a very close watch and look at its spread so that it will give us transmission efficiency," he said.</p>

<p>Arora said the number of cases identified of Delta plus variant may be more as there may be many asymptomatic individuals also -- those who do not have any COVID-19 symptoms but they are carrying the virus and spreading it.</p>

<p>"But the important point is that our genomic surveillance component has picked it up rightly and early enough.</p>

<p>Now what will happen is that states have already been told that it is a variant of concern and it requires action which means that several states have already started making micro plans for the districts where the virus is identified so that their spread can be contained.</p>

<p>Obviously vaccination will have to be increased in these districts," he said.</p>

<p>Responding to a question if the Delta plus variant can trigger the third wave of coronavirus, Arora said it is difficult to assess that as of now.</p>

<p>"Waves are linked to new variants or new mutations so there is a possibility as this is a new variant, but whether it will lead to a third wave it is difficult to answer as it will depend upon two or three things," he said.</p>

<p>"The first thing is we had a ferocious second wave in the last three months and it is still going on, we are seeing for the last 8-10 days the number of cases are stuck at 50,000, while at some places cases continue to come so that wave has not settled down," he said.</p>

<p>He said the second wave will influence the community's response to another variant and the third wave will depend upon what proportion of the population got infected in the second wave.</p>

<p>"If a large proportion is infected then in the next wave people can develop a common cold like illness but may not develop a serious or fatal illness," he said.</p>

<p>"Secondly, another thing that is important is vaccination -- the rapidity with which we vaccinate even single dose is effective and the way we are planning, if we rapidly immunise then possibility of third wave becomes very less because vaccine plus infection plus Covid appropriate behaviour will save us from next wave, mitigate the next wave and the third wave will not be able to cause the damage as was caused in the first two waves," he added.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[RJD celebrates its foundation day with much fanfare every year on July 5 and this year, the party  will start the day by offering floral  tributes  to (late) Ram Vilas Paswan.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>PATNA: A new twist in Bihar's politics is expected to brew ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections as the state's principal opposition party, RJD, is leaving no stone unturned to polarise the opposition against the NDA.</p>

<p>Experts believe, RJD's decision to celebrate the birth anniversary of LJP founder and former union minister (late) Ram Vilas Paswan on the same day as RJD's foundation day, July 5, can have a far fetched impact on Bihar's politics.</p>

<p>RJD's decision has assumed more political significane now as Chirag Paswan, son of (late) Ram Vilas Paswan, has been left alone after a leadership coup in LJP, headed by his own uncle, removed him as the party president.</p>

<p>RJD celebrates its foundation day with much fanfare every year on July 5. This year, the party will start the day by offering floral tributes to Ram Vilas Paswan.</p>

<p>Political experts see this exercise by RJD leaders as an attempt to bring Chirag Paswan to their camp. Chirag's faction of the LJP is being offered full support from the RJD and other parties in opposition.</p>

<p>According to sources, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav wants Chirag Paswan on his side so that it reaps some benefits during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and 2025 Assembly elections. Infact, prior to this, Tejashwi had offered Chiarg to work with him if the latter was ready to follow ideologies of BR Ambedkar.</p>

<p>A new political equation among the oppostion parties can cause major problem for the BJP in their schedule caste vote-bank.</p>

<p>RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said "It's not a political move if the RJD wants to pay tributes on the birth anniversary of a great socialist leader like Ram Vilas Paswan."</p>

<p>Son in-law of Ram Vilas Paswan, Anil K Sadhu, who is a RJD leader, welcomed the party's decision.</p>

<p>"It is great that on July 5, RJD has announced to celebrate the birth anniversary of Bahujan Mahanayak and the messiah of Dalits (late) Ram Vilas Paswan ji. Thanks RJD President Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav ji for this announcement", Sadhu wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Chirag Paswan has also decided to take out a state-wide 'ashirvad yatra' in Hajipur to propogate the socialist beliefs of his late father on July 5.</p>

<p>According to political experts, the longer BJP remais silent over the recent political coup in LJP, the bigger loss it would have in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, sources from Mahagatbandhan said that Chirag Paswan is continuously in talks with Tejashwi Yadav after the revolt against him in LJP.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">RAIPUR: Police have cracked a 10-year-old murder case after an accused during a casual conversation with a friend told him that he had killed a man in Raipur in 2011, an official said on Sunday.</p>

<p>After getting the lead, the police on Friday arrested the main accused, identified as Santosh Yadav alias Ghanshyam (30), and his associate Lokesh Yadav (32), Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural) Tarkeshwar Patel said.</p>

<p>The victim, Lekhram Sen (40), a resident of Kosrangi village here in Chhattisgarh, was killed in January 2011 at Farhada village in the district, he said.</p>

<p>Santosh Yadav, during a conversation recently with a friend at a 'dhaba' (roadside eatery) in Farhada village, told him that he killed Sen in 2011, following which the police got a whiff of it and rounded him up a few days back.</p>

<p>The official said during questioning, Santosh Yadav told the police that he strangulated Sen to death in January 2011 with the help of Lokesh Yadav and dumped the body at a paddy field in Farhada village.</p>

<p>In his statement to police, Santosh said in 2011, he went to his maternal home and got into a relationship with a girl.</p>

<p>While he was meeting his girlfriend at a paddy field in the village late at night, Sen, who was passing by, spotted the duo and threatened them to reveal about their relationship to villagers," the official said.</p>

<p>"Later, Santosh with the help of Lokesh allegedly strangulated Sen to death with his belt," Patel said quoting the statement of the main accused.</p>

<p>The two accused have been booked under relevant sections, he added.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">BHOPAL: The famous Mahakaleshwar temple at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh will reopen for devotees on Monday after a gap of 80 days, a member of its management committee said.</p>

<p>The temple was shut for the public on April 9 this year following a rise in daily COVID-19 cases in the state.</p>

<p>It had to be closed for the second time during the pandemic that broke out last year, he said.</p>

<p>"It will reopen tomorrow at 6 am," the temple's assistant administrator R K Tiwari told PTI over phone on Sunday.</p>

<p>However, the entry to the temple's sanctum sanctorum and Nandi hall would not be allowed, he said.</p>

<p>"Devotees have to take online permission for the deity's 'darshan' at the temple.</p>

<p>Those who have received at least one shot of vaccine against coronavirus would have to show its certificate to enter the temple, or else, carry an RT-PCR negative test report issued 48 hours before entering the religious premises," he said.</p>

<p>The official further said 3,500 devotees would be permitted to enter the temple between 6 am and 8 pm in a day.</p>

<p>There will be seven time slots of two hours each and 500 people will be allowed to enter the temple in each slot.</p>

<p>Tiwari said COVID-19 appropriate behaviour would be strictly followed at the temple.</p>

<p>"Devotees will have to adhere to all safety measures, like physical distancing and wearing masks," he said.</p>

<p>Before the outbreak of COVID-19, around 20,000 people used to visit the temple every day, he said.</p>

<p>The temple, located about 175 km from the state capital Bhopal, is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is one of the 12 'jyotirlingas' in the country.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">LUCKNOW: BSP supremo Mayawati on Sunday categorically denied any alliance with the AIMIM for the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

<p>In a series of tweets in Hindi, she said, "A news channel is broadcasting news since yesterday that in the upcoming UP Assembly elections, BSP will contest along with (Asaduddin) Owaisi's party AIMIM. This news is completely wrong, misleading and devoid of any fact. There is not even an iota of truth in this. The BSP vociferously denies this.</p>

<p>"The party wants to clarify that barring Punjab, the BSP will be contesting the Assembly elections to be held in UP and Uttarakhand alone, and will not be entering into any alliance with anyone," she said in another tweet.</p>

<p>Taking cognizance of such misleading news, BSP general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Misra has been made the national co-ordinator of the party's media cell, Mayawati said.</p>

<p>She also appealed to the media to consult Misra before publishing any news regarding the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) or its national president.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Cautioning people that the threat of COVID-19 remains, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged them to shed vaccine hesitancy and get themselves inoculated soon.</p>

<p>In his monthly Mann ki Baat broadcast, Modi hailed the feat of most vaccination doses administered in a single day on June 21 at the start of the new phase of inoculation under which all adults are being given free jabs.</p>

<p>Seeking to make people shed vaccine hesitancy, Modi spoke to residents of Dulariya village in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh and counselled them to take the vaccine amidst their doubts about the exercise.</p>

<p>He noted that both he and his nearly 100-year-old mother have taken both doses of the vaccine, and asked people not to believe in rumours and trust science and scientists.</p>

<p>"The threat of COVID-19 remains and we have to focus on vaccination as well as follow COVID-19 protocols," he said.</p>

<p>With the Monsoon approaching, Modi also stressed on water conservation.</p>

<p>In his broadcast, he also paid tributes and remembered the contribution of Indian sprint legend Milkha Singh, who died earlier this month.</p>

<p>Modi hailed Singh's contribution to Indian sports and said he will always cherish his interactions with the athlete.</p>

<p>Singh died in a Chandigarh hospital after a month-long battle with COVID-19.</p>

<p>He also lost his wife Nirmal Kaur, a former national volleyball captain, to the same disease.</p>

<p>Modi also shared the struggles and triumphs of Olympics-bound Indian athletes and said that people must not build any pressure on these sports persons but "cheer for India".</p>

<p>"Every athlete who is going to Tokyo has worked hard.</p>

<p>They are going there to win hearts.</p>

<p>It must be our endeavour to support our team and not put pressure on the team," he said.</p>]]></story>

<title>Chhattisgarh industries struggle with acute shortage of iron ore</title>
<author>Ejaz Kaiser</author>

<description><![CDATA[Owing to the crisis, major Corporates are seen setting up their industries in places like Odisha, Gujarat and southern states instead of Chhattisgarh.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh, the second largest sponge iron producer in the country and the only one to make high grade rails for the Railways, is grappling with acute shortage of iron ore.</p>

<p>The industries in the state are reported to be persistently confronting the issue of demand-supply on iron-ore. Owing to the crisis, major Corporates are seen setting up their industries in places like Odisha, Gujarat and southern states instead of Chhattisgarh.</p>

<p>Total installed capacity of sponge iron in the state is 11.28 MTPA (25 per cent of India) -- effectively contributing for the country as the world’s largest producer at 37 million tonne annually. </p>

<p>The state has 11.6 million tonne steel capacity and has a share of 20 per cent (4 billion tonne) in iron ore deposit overall.</p>

<p>The mining giant National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) is the only commercial miner in the state. The Federation of Indian chambers of Commerce and Industries (FICCI) has stated that the production level of iron ore in Chhattisgarh is almost stagnant for over five years and appealed to the Centre to direct the NMDC to increase the capacity.</p>

<p>“We are deeply concerned as over 89 percent, which is 24 million tonnes of iron ore production of NMDC mines, are being exported outside the state creating a huge scarcity of iron ore in the state. Recently, there has also been an exorbitant surge in prices of iron ore by NMDC”, said Pradeep Tandon, Chairman for state council of FICCI. </p>

<p>"The cost Rs 3,391 per tonne of fine grade iron ore in April last year was increased to Rs 5,608 per tonne in March this year, registering an increase by 74 per cent. Even for ore lumps the prices has been substantially increased by 57 per cent," FICCI added.</p>

<p>Citing the NMDC record on production details, FICCI pointed out that the stagnant production, much lower than the rated capacity of the nation’s largest iron ore public sector enterprise, is even causing revenue losses of Rs 411 crore annually.</p>

<p>However NMDC officials countered citing that out of the installed capacity of 29 million tonne in Chhattisgarh the organisation is producing close to 92 per cent of its capacity. “There are around 60 customers whom we are providing iron ore to Chhattisgarh. We meet the demands raised by them”, they said. </p>

<p>NMDC admitted that the rates have increased but felt the need of more railway rakes, doubling of tracks amid the issues of security owing to the presence of Maoists in the region. </p>

<p>FICCI meanwhile has written to Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel identifying the states that have taken proactive measures to support their state-based end-use plants safeguarding interest of the industries, the revenues for the states besides the employment and value addition in iron and steel industry. </p>

<p>The corporates have raised demand for pre-emption policy which is first right in raw material provision under the Mineral Concession Rules-2016 under rule number 12 (1) in Chhattisgarh to avert the ongoing mineral crisis by ensuring adequate supply to the industries in the state.</p>

<p>M Nagaraju, additional secretary, ministry of coal, referred Chhattisgarh as crucial for the country especially in the mining, which is a vital sector for development of state and nation.</p>]]></story>

<title>No question of anyone being left out in Covid vaccination due to digital divide: Centre to SC</title>

<description><![CDATA[Online registration, prior self-registration and booking of appointment on Co-WIN is also not mandatory to avail vaccination services, it stated.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday told the Supreme Court that digital divide is no more a constraint as walk-in Covid vaccination has been permitted and a poor person and a multi-millionaire in the 18 years and above age group are equally entitled to get vaccine free of cost.</p>

<p>Till June 25, over 31 crore doses have been administered in the country to curb the pandemic, the government said while responding to a slew of questions raised by the apex court in its May 31 order during hearing of a suo motu case related to Covid management.</p>

<p>In a 375-page affidavit filed in the apex court, Union health ministry said as per the projected mid-year population for 2020, the population of the country aged 18 years and above is approximately 93-94 crore and as such, administering two doses to these beneficiaries would require an estimated 186 to 188 crore doses.</p>

<p>"Out of this requirement, 51.6 crore doses will be made available for administration by July 31, 2021, leaving a requirement of approximately 135 crore vaccine doses for complete vaccination to the eligible population," it said.</p>

<p>Giving the breakup for vaccines' quantity that may be receivable from all sources the Centre said 135 crore doses will be procured: Covishield (50 crore), Covaxin (40 crore), Bio E Subunit vaccine (30 crore), Zydus Cadila DNA vaccine (5 crore) and Sputnik V (10 crore).</p>

<p>It said procurement of Bio E Subunit vaccine and Zydus Cadila DNA vaccine will be subject to approval which will come in the near future.</p>

<p>The Centre said every effort is being made to ensure access to "safe and effective vaccines at the earliest".</p>

<p>A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud had slammed the Centre's Covid vaccination policy, describing as "prima facie arbitrary and irrational" allowing states and private hospitals to charge those in the 18-44 age group while jabs were offered free for groups in the first two phases, and ordered its review.</p>

<p>Seeking to scrutinise the vaccination policy in detail, the top court had also asked the Centre to provide information including as to how Rs 35,000 crore earmarked for vaccines has been spent so far, and to place on record all relevant documents and file notings reflecting its thinking culminating in the policy.</p>

<p>Bringing the revised "Covid-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines" on record, the Centre's reply affidavit said, "Under the revised guidelines, government of India will procure vaccine and supply free of cost to the states and union territories (UTs) to vaccinate all persons above 18 years of age from 21.06.2021 and this will ensure that 18-44 years persons will also receive free vaccine from government Covid vaccination centres."</p>

<p>"To put the same position differently, a person below poverty line and a multi-millionaire are equally entitled for the very same vaccine in the age group of 18 years and above free of cost," it said.</p>

<p>Only those who have the ability to pay and voluntarily chose to pay are encouraged to use private hospitals' vaccination centres so that stress on public utilities can be reduced to the extent possible, the affidavit said.</p>

<p>The sum total of revised and reviewed vaccination programmes is that the Centre will procure vaccines and make every effort possible to ensure people have access to safe and effective vaccines at the earliest, it said.</p>

<p>It said over 31 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the country till June 25 and the government has allowed on-site registration for vaccination to bridge the digital divide and solve the issue pointed out by the top court.</p>

<p>"Now online registration and prior self-registration and booking of appointment on Co-WIN is not mandatory to avail vaccination services," it said.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that, as on June 23, 2021, out of 32.22 crore beneficiaries registered on Co-WIN in the country, 19.13 crore (59 per cent) beneficiaries have been registered in the onsite (walk-in/non-digital) mode," the affidavit said.</p>

<p>The affidavit said all necessary features to ensure every eligible individual has access to vaccination, regardless of any physical, digital or socio-economic barriers, have been incorporated in Co-WIN.</p>

<p>It said on-site registrations, also called walk-in registration, and vaccinations have been permitted for all beneficiaries through a May 23 circular.</p>

<p>"It is humbly submitted that as on June 25, over 31 crore vaccine doses have been administered across the country and this includes 1,73,35,543 doses to healthcare workers," it said.</p>

<p>"Total 44.2 per cent of priority population of persons above 45 years of age and 13 per cent of population group of 18-44 years of age have received first vaccine dose," it said, adding that 27.3 per cent eligible population of 18 years and above has received first dose.</p>

<p>On vaccine availability, the Centre said, "Two vaccines (Covishield & Covaxin) have been a part of the vaccination programme since January 2021.</p>

<p>Another COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V developed by Gamaleya Institute, Russia, has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the DCGI (Drugs Controller General of India) in April 2021 and is now being administered in India."</p>

<p>It also answered queries on status of vaccine availability for children and said as of now, manufacturing companies have only been given EAU for vaccinating people of 18 years and above.</p>

<p>"Therefore, Covid vaccines are not recommended for persons/children less than 18 years of age and is due to the fact that clinical trial cohort during Phase 1, 2 & 3 did not cove children below 18 years of age," it said.</p>

<p>The ministry, however, said on May 12, the DCGI has permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials on healthy volunteers between two to 18 years for Covaxin and enrolment process it has also begun.</p>

<p>The apex court's May 31 order, uploaded on its site on June 2, was critical of the Centre's decisions on liberalised vaccination policy, differential pricing of vaccines for Centre, states and private hospitals, mandatory registration on CoWIN app for booking slots for jabs in view of huge digital divide between rural and urban India, and it had sought response.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">KOLKATA: Kolkata Police on Saturday included the charge of attempt to murder along with other sections of the IPC against a man who allegedly impersonated as an IAS officer and organised COVID-19 vaccination camps together with three of his associates, officials said.</p>

<p>Debanjan Deb, 28, and his accomplices have also been charged with criminal conspiracy, forgery and cheating.</p>

<p>He was arrested on Wednesday for masquerading as a joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation and operating a immunisation camp in Kasba area, where actor and Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty had also got her jab.</p>

<p>According to a top source in the state government, the decision to include the attempt to murder charge against all the four was taken at the "direction of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee".</p>

<p>The West Bengal government has also set up an expert committee to examine the effect of fake vaccination administered to people at the camp and take corrective action, a senior police officer said.</p>

<p>The four-member panel will be submitting a detailed report very soon, a health department official said.</p>

<p>Health camps were also organised by the government for those who had been given the shots at the camps run by Deb.</p>

<p>"Initial findings suggest that people were administered antibiotic Amikacin instead of Covid vaccines, and it had no major impact on their health," a health department source said.</p>

<p>The department also released a set of SOPs for operating Covid vaccination centres or camps under non- government initiative.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Kolkata Police arrested the three associates of Deb.</p>

<p>Two of them were found to be signatories to a fake bank account that was registered against the name of Kolkata Municipal Corporation, officials said.</p>

<p>The third was on the payroll of Deb and had actively taken part in the vaccination camps, they said.</p>

<p>"One is a resident of Salt Lake while another is from Barasat. Both were called for questioning before they were arrested," a senior police officer said.</p>

<p>The "employee" of Deb hails from Taltala.</p>

<p>All four of them were produced in a local court on Saturday.</p>

<p>Three more cases have been registered against Deb at Kasba Police Station, he said.</p>

<p>The TMC MP, who was invited to attend the camp, was the first to raise alarm after she did not receive the customary message sent to those who are inoculated.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Centre Saturday told the Supreme Court that a total of 51.6 crore Covid vaccine doses would be made available by July 31 of which 35.6 crore have already been provided.</p>

<p>Giving the status of vaccine availability for children, the Centre said in an affidavit that the Drugs Controller General of India on May 12 permitted Bharat Biotech to conduct clinical trials of its vaccine Covaxin on volunteers between 2 to 18 years of age, and the enrolment process for this trial has also begun.</p>

<p>It informed the court that Zydus Cadila which is developing DNA vaccines has concluded its clinical trial for between the age group of 12 to 18 years of age and, subject to the statutory permissions, it may be available in near future for children of the age group of 12 to 18 years of age.</p>

<p>"It is humbly submitted that as of now, the companies' manufacturing COVID-19 vaccination in India have only been given 'Emergency Use Authorization' for vaccinating people of 18 years age and above.</p>

<p>Therefore, COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for persons/children less than 18 years of age and is due to the fact that the clinical trial cohort during Phase 1, 2 and 3 did not cover the children below 18 years of age," it said.</p>

<p>The government said that there would be availability of vaccine to vaccinate the entire eligible population.</p>

<p>It said the "biggest vaccination drive in the history" is going on with full swing, reaching even remotest areas of the country by constructive and cooperative collaboration of the Central government, State/UT governments, local authorities, human resources in medical sectors and the citizens of the country.</p>

<p>Giving the break-up of vaccines till the date of filing of the affidavit i.e.June 26, the Centre said a total of 35.6 crore doses were made available -- 26.6 crore Covishield, 8 crore Covaxin, and additional 1 crore doses as commodity assistance under COVAX facility.</p>

<p>It also said that apart from these supplies, it is expected that around 16 crore doses will also be available during the period of May and July across the country.</p>

<p>The Centre further said that 31.5 lakh doses of first component and 60,000 doses of second component of Sputnik V has been received.</p>

<p>It said that two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) have been a part of the vaccination program since January 2021 and Sputnik V has received Emergency Use Authoridation by the DCGI in April 2021 and is now being administered in the country.</p>

<p>The government said, "In addition, some other domestic vaccines such as those from Biological E and Zydus Cadila are in the late stages of clinical trials and subject to the regulatory approvals, will further increase the availability of vaccines."</p>

<p>The government in its 380-page affidavit filed in the suo motu matter on COVID-19 management said that in order to further increase vaccine availability and incentivising foreign manufacturers, the regulatory process for the use of foreign vaccines within India has been accelerated and simplified.</p>

<p>It clarified that due to the initial assistance provided for developing Covaxin, it has ensured a price of Rs.150 per dose of Covaxin and it is not possible to reduce it any further.</p>

<p>"This price is the lowest procurement price in the world."</p>

<p>The government said that as per the projected mid-year population for 2020, the total population of the country aged 18 years and above is approximately 93-94 crore and as such, administering two doses to these beneficiaries would require an estimated 186 to 188 crore vaccine doses.</p>

<p>"Out of this requirement, 51.6 crore doses will be made available for administration by July 31, 2021, leaving a requirement of approximately 135 crore vaccine doses for complete vaccination to the eligible population," it said.</p>

<p>Giving the breakup for vaccines quantity that may be receivable from all sources the Centre said that a total of 135 crore doses will be procured: Covishield (50 crore), Covaxin (40 crore), Bio E Subunit vaccine (30 crore), Zydus Cadila DNA vaccine (5 crore) and Sputnik V (10 crore).</p>

<p>It said that the procurement of Bio E Subunit vaccine and Zydus Cadila DNA vaccine will be subject to approval which will come in the near future.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that the vaccination drive would obviously get a boost if the Government of India succeeds in its attempts to procure vaccines available outside India such as vaccines of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna etc," the affidavit said.</p>

<p>The Centre said that for the purpose of procurement of these vaccines from abroad, efforts are ongoing at the level of the highest political executive in the country and also at the highest diplomatic level.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that since these efforts are at a very advanced stage, it is neither desirable nor possible to give comprehensive details of these facts. As and when these efforts materialise, the speed of vaccination will be further augmented and enhanced," it said.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[The government said in May, 3,91,80,160 doses were available for states and UTs, and private hospitals, which would be proportionate to the people of 18-45 age group in each state and UT.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday told the Supreme Court that till June 25 more than 31 crore Covid vaccine doses have been administered across the country which includes over 1.73 crore doses to Health Care Workers (HCWs).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Over 2.66 crore doses have been administered to Frontline Workers (FLWs), over 9.93 crores doses to persons between 45 to 59 years of age and over 8.96 crore doses to persons above the age of 60 years, it said.</p>

<p>The government said besides these, over 7.84 crore doses have been administered to persons between 18 to 44 years of age.</p>

<p>"Total 44.2 per cent of the priority population of persons above 45 years of age and 13 per cent of the population group of 18-44 years of age have received the first vaccine dose," the Centre said in its affidavit filed in the top court in the suo motu matter on COVID-19 management.</p>

<p>The Centre which gave the status of COVID-19 vaccines administered from January to June 25 said that a total of 27.3 per cent of the eligible population (18 years and above) have received one dose of vaccine.</p>

<p>"It is humbly submitted that prior to the initiation of the New Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National COVID Vaccination Strategy on May 1, 2021; a total of 15,49,89,635 (15.49 crore) COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in the country from January 16 to April 30, 2021," it said, adding that the total figure includes 94,12,140 doses to HCWs and 1,25,58,069 doses to FLWs.</p>

<p>This also includes 5,27,07,921 doses to people in the 45 to 59 years of age group and 5,23,78,616 doses for people above the age of 60 years, the Centre said.</p>

<p>"It is further stated that, in the month of May, 2021, a total of 4,03,49,830 doses were provided by Union government to the states and union territories (UTs) for vaccination of priority group of HCWs, FLWs and persons aged 45 years plus and above as supply from government of India channel, for which no amount is collected from anyone," it said.</p>

<p>The government said in May, 3,91,80,160 doses were available for states and UTs, and private hospitals, which would be proportionate to the people of 18-45 age group in each state and UT.</p>

<p>Therefore, in May, 7,95,29,990 doses were available for the national COVID-19 vaccination programme, it said.</p>

<p>The Centre said each state is informed by it in writing about the number of vaccine doses it would receive on a monthly basis and this exercise is absolutely essential so as to have uniform vaccination throughout the country.</p>

<p>"This endeavour can be successful only by treating India as one unit and considering the question on a pan-India basis. This can be achieved only with each state following the discipline in letter and spirit, and be in tune with simultaneous vaccination of the country avoiding any demands by one state at the cost of other states and residents of the rest of the country," it said.</p>

<p>The Centre said, similarly, in May and June, it has provided advance information to states and UTs regarding vaccine doses to be supplied to them for July.</p>

<p>"It is humbly submitted that allocation for the month of July 2021 for available vaccines was done amongst all States/ UTs on a pro-rata basis based on population of 18 years and above, it said.</p>

<p>It said that there is no global scientific evidence of viruses selecting to affect a particular age group.</p>

<p>The central government said it has ensured that all state governments are geared-up to deal with any such potential threat to children.</p>

<p>"Since health is a state subject and hospitals are under the state governments, the central government has proactively prepared two SOPs - one for prescribing an ideal clinical treatment and second prescribing the infrastructural facilities mandated in the hospitals," it said.</p>

<p>The Centre added that it is in constant and direct touch with state governments to ensure that these facilities are created and augmented on war footing.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The central government on Saturday told the Supreme Court that under the national COVID-19 vaccination programme it has devised a strategy to inoculate the elderly and the differently abled, who may have been left behind because of inability to travel to vaccination centres.</p>

<p>It said that therefore, in view of this need and to ensure easy access, it was felt pertinent to bring vaccination services closer to the community and nearer to homes, while maintaining all necessary precautions and safety measures, according to operational guidelines and advisories issued from time to time.</p>

<p>The government said that the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has issued its directive on May 29, prohibiting carrying out any vaccination drives in star hotels.</p>

<p>Such drive must be stopped immediately or necessary legal and administrative actions would be initiated against such erring institutions, it said.</p>

<p>"In this regard it is submitted that the MoHFW constituted a committee consisting of domain knowledge experts to examine this issue which recommended the strategy of Near to Home COVID Vaccination Centres (NHCVC) to cater to special needs of elderly and differently abled persons," it said, adding that this strategy has also been endorsed by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC), which has both government and non-government experts.</p>

<p>The Centre said that the strategy of NHCVC for the elderly and the differently abled is flexible, people-centric and follows a community-based approach, where sessions can be conducted in non-health facility based settings and are nearer to home, like in a community centre or residents welfare association, office, panchayat ghar, school buildings, old age homes, sub-health centres and health and wellness centres with availability of adequate space.</p>

<p>Giving the details of the strategy, the Centre said under the setup, the overall planning, review and implementation will be the responsibility of district, urban or block task forces.</p>

<p>"The NHCVC will be linked to an existing CVC for planning and execution of the vaccination session. These NHCVC will be organised especially for this target population (that is all individuals above 60 years of age and individuals below 60 years with disability due to physical or medical conditions) while vaccination for all other age groups will continue at the existing CVCs," it said.</p>

<p>The Centre's affidavit filed in the suo motu matter on COVID-19 management said that the beneficiaries can either register themselves in advance, on-site or can register following the Facilitated Cohort Registration process on Co-WIN.</p>

<p>"For management of any adverse event following immunization (AEFI), an advanced life support/basic life support/transport vehicle must be stationed at the NHCVCs for transport to nearby AEFI Management Centre'', it said.</p>

<p>The Centre said that guidelines on NHCVC was shared with all states and union territories on May 27 and is also available on the health ministry's website.</p>

<p>It said that the MoHFW has issued an advisory to the state and Union Territory governments that officials like district level officers of the disability or social welfare departments should be considered as designated nodal officer for the purpose.</p>

<p>The nodal officer will also deal with redressal of grievances of differently abled persons in connection with COVID-19 on real-time basis, the Centre said.</p>]]></story>

<title>Samajwadi Party ousts its 11 district chiefs ahead of zila panchayat polls</title>

<description><![CDATA[Reports suggested that  party #39;s nominees in many places not turning  up for filing their nomination papers for the post of zila panchayat chairman behind the drastic move.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">LUCKNOW: The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Saturday sacked the presidents of its 11 district units with immediate effect.</p>

<p>Uttar Pradesh SP chief Naresh Uttam issued a statement here, saying the presidents of the party's Gorakhpur, Moradabad, Jhansi, Agra, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Mau, Balrampur, Shravasti, Bhadohi, Gonda and Lalitpur district units have been removed on the direction of party president Akhilesh Yadav.</p>

<p>Though the statement cited no reason for the move, reports reaching here from some districts said the party's nominees in many places did not turn up for filing their nomination papers for the post of zila panchayat chairman.</p>

<p>Yadav, however, alleged that many SP nominees were "prevented" from filing nomination papers.</p>

<p>"The way in which the BJP government has prevented the Samajwadi Party candidates from filing nominations for the election of panchayat chairperson in Gorakhpur and elsewhere, it is a new administrative tactic of the defeated BJP to win the election. The people will not even give as many seats in the Assembly to the BJP as they will make panchayat chiefs," he said in a tweet.</p>

<p>In Bhadohi, the party's nominee, Shyam Kumari Maurya, whose candidature was announced about a month ago, did not turn up for filing her nomination.</p>

<p>In Gorakhpur, SP candidate Jitendra Yadav was also not able to file his papers.</p>

<p>On Saturday, nominations were filed in all districts of the state for the post of zila panchayat chairman, and the polling will take place on July 3.</p>]]></story>

<title>Sought time from RSS chief to hand over proof of scam in Ayodhya land deal: Sanjay Singh</title>

<description><![CDATA[At a press conference, the AAP leader said that Bhagwat, who claims himself to be the  quot;upholder of Hinduvaad quot; should take note and objectively clear his stand on the allegations.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: AAP leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh on Saturday said that he has written to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat and asked for time to meet him and handover all "proof" of the alleged corruption in a land deal by the Ram temple trust in Ayodhya.</p>

<p>Singh and former SP MLA from Ayodhya Pawan Pandey had recently alleged that a piece of land worth Rs 2 crore was purchased by the Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust in Ayodhya at an inflated price of Rs 18.5 crore.</p>

<p>At a press conference, the AAP leader said that Bhagwat, who claims himself to be the "upholder of Hinduvaad" should take note and objectively clear his stand on the allegations.</p>

<p>"I have written a letter to RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat ji and have asked for time to meet him.</p>

<p>I will hand over all these documents as proof of the scam related to land and corruption by the BJP and the members of the trust to him," Singh said.</p>

<p>He further said that even though the alleged corruption in the land deal is in the public eye, "where are all the investigation agencies and why are they not acting".</p>

<p>"The prime minister (Narendra Modi) convened a meeting with the members of the trust today. Did he ask why the scam happened and why is the construction of the temple halted?" the Rajya Sabha MP posed.</p>

<p>Singh and Pandey had alleged money laundering in the deal and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).</p>

<p>The Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust's general secretary Champat Rai strongly dismissed the allegations, claiming the land was purchased at a price much lower than the prevailing market rate.</p>]]></story>

<title>Poor as well as multi-millionaire of 18 years and above to get free Covid jabs: Centre to SC</title>

<description><![CDATA[A 375-page affidavit was filed by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in response to a slew of questions raised by the apex court in its May 31 order.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: A poor person and a multi-millionaire in the age group of 18 years and above are equally entitled to get the Covid vaccine free of cost and every effort is being made to ensure access of "safe and effective" ones at the earliest in the country, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Saturday.</p>

<p>A 375-page affidavit was filed by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in response to a slew of questions raised by the apex court in its May 31 order while hearing the suo motu case related to Covid management in the country.</p>

<p>A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud had slammed the Centre's Covid vaccination policy, describing as "prima facie arbitrary and irrational" allowing states and private hospitals to charge those in the 18-44 age group while the jabs were offered free for groups in the first two phases, and ordered its review.</p>

<p>Seeking to scrutinise the Covid vaccination policy in detail, the top court had also asked the Centre to provide information including as to how Rs 35,000 crore, earmarked for vaccines, has been spent so far, and to place on record all relevant documents and file notings reflecting its thinking culminating in the policy.</p>

<p>Bringing the revised "Covid-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines" on the record, the Centre's reply affidavit said, "Under the revised guidelines, government of India will procure vaccine and supply free of cost to the states/ UTs to vaccinate all persons above 18 years of age from 21.06.2021 and this will ensure that 18-44 years persons will also receive free vaccine from government Covid vaccination centres."</p>

<p>"To put the same position differently, a person below poverty line and a multi-millionaire are equally entitled for the very same vaccine in the age group of 18 years and above free of cost," the affidavit said.</p>

<p>Only those who have the ability to pay and voluntarily chose to pay are encouraged to use private hospitals' vaccination centres so that the stress on public utilities can be reduced to the extent possible, it said.</p>

<p>The sum total of revised and reviewed vaccination programmes is that the Central government will procure vaccines and make every effort possible to ensure that the people of India have access to safe and effective vaccines at the earliest, the reply affidavit said.</p>

<p>It said more than 31 crore vaccine doses have been administered across the country and the government has allowed on-site registration for vaccination to bridge the digital divide and solve the issue pointed out by the top court.</p>

<p>The affidavit also dealt with the issue of shortage of medicines like Amphotericin to deal with Mucormycosis and Remdesivir.</p>

<p>The apex court's May 31 order, uploaded on its site on June 2, was critical of the Centre's decisions on liberalised vaccination policy, differential pricing of vaccines for Centre, states and private hospitals, basis of such a norm and mandatory registration on CoWIN app for booking slots for jabs in view of huge digital divide between rural and urban India and sought response from the government on its queries in in two weeks.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">SHIMLA: The Himachal Pradesh State Commission for Women has sought report from Kangra superintendent of police over the allegations that Dharamshala BJP MLA Vishal Nehriya tortured his wife.</p>

<p>Commission chairperson Daisy Thakur told PTI that they took suo motu cognisance of the matter on the basis of a video that surfaced on the social media.</p>

<p>In the video, 2020-batch Himachal Pradesh Administrative Services (HPAS) officer Oshin Sharma alleged that her husband Vishal Nehriya tortured her physically and mentally.</p>

<p>In a letter to Kangra SP Vimukt Ranjan, the commission asked him to submit a report immediately, she added.</p>

<p>However, the SP was not available for comments despite repeated attempts.</p>

<p>In the video that surfaced on social media on Friday, Oshin Sharma alleged that the BJP legislator slapped her thrice on Thursday.</p>

<p>Nehriya and Sharma had married two months ago on April 26.</p>

<p>Sharma said she has now returned to her maternal house.</p>

<p>The HPAS officer claimed that Nehriya had also beaten her in February this year at a Chandigarh hotel.</p>

<p>The BJP MLA neither answered to the phone calls nor replied to messages sent to get his version.</p>

<p>Nehriya (32) was elected as an MLA from Dharamshala in the bypolls two years ago.</p>

<p>Sharma also alleged that her husband had expelled her from his house on the fourth day of their marriage when she tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Sharma said she had agreed to return then as he threatened to harm himself.</p>

<p>The HPAS officer also stated that she knew Nehariya since their college days.</p>

<p>She said she had ended her relationship with him then as he used to beat her even during those days.</p>

<p>However, Nehariya asked Sharma to marry him in 2019 after becoming the MLA and she agreed as she thought he was genuinely interested in her, according to the officer.</p>

<p>Sharma also accused her in-laws of demanding dowry and said her parents had given them a gold chain worth Rs 1.20 lakh and a ring worth Rs 1 lakh at the time of marriage.</p>

<p>She added that her husband's family has also levelled allegations of torture against her.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Centre said the possibility of a resurgence would necessarily be  quot;speculative quot; at this stage.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday told the Supreme Court that it is "continuously preparing" the states and union territories, and their infrastructure to deal with future resurgence of COVID-19 in the country.</p>

<p>In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Centre said the possibility of a resurgence would necessarily be "speculative" at this stage.</p>

<p>However, the possibility of resurgence would depend on the behaviour pattern of the virus, behaviour of citizens as to whether they are following Covid appropriate behaviour or not, the affidavit said.</p>

<p>"State governments/union territories (UTs) have been cautioned to maintain a continuous vigil and plan in advance for any exigencies that may arise due to resurgence of COVID-19 in their respective states," said the affidavit which was filed in the top court in the suo motu case on distribution of essential supplies and services during the pandemic.</p>

<p>It said on May 29, 10 empowered groups in government of India were reconstituted, keeping such potential threat in mind, to facilitate inter-ministerial coordination and fast-track decision making on various facets of COVID-19 management.</p>

<p>"These include empowered groups on (i) emergency management plan and strategy, (ii) emergency response capabilities, (iii) augmenting human resources and capacity building, (iv) oxygen (v) vaccination, (vi) testing (vii) partnership (viii) information, communication and public engagement (ix) economic and welfare measures and (x) pandemic response and coordination," the affidavit said.</p>

<p>It said the Centre is in close and continuous collaboration with states and UTs, and is monitoring the COVID-19 situation throughout the country up to the district level on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The affidavit said the website of the Union health ministry displays on a daily basis the district-wise positivity trend to guide states to take appropriate public health response.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that though the trajectory of the COVID-19 spread throughout the country is encouraging as of now, the central government is continuously preparing state governments/UTs, and their infrastructure to meet with any future resurgence," it said.</p>

<p>It said communications are regularly being sent to states on current trajectory of cases, need for adherence to the 'test-track-treat' policy for containment of outbreaks, need for adherence to Covid appropriate behaviour, vaccination and other related issues.</p>

<p>In the affidavit, the Centre said that states are being provided with projections on future requirements of bed capacities in Covid health care facilities based on existing trends of cases.</p>

<p>"It is also stated that all states have been provided with detailed measures on containment, besides a template for preparation of district action plan. The high case load districts have been specifically reviewed and asked to present their district action plan for COVID-19 management during the periodical and regular video conferences held by the central government at various levels," it said.</p>

<p>It said advisories and protocols specifically related to clinical management have been refined and updated in expert consultation, and widely circulated to optimise treatment outcomes and minimise mortality.</p>

<p>It said that technical advisories have also been issued for management of Mucormycosis (black fungus).</p>

<p>"It is submitted that with a view to increase the availability of trained human resources to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic situation and any potential resurgence, states have been advised to explore avenues for utilisation of services of medical interns, final-year MBBS students, final-year PG students as well as final-year super-specialty students as residents," it said.</p>

<p>"It was also advised to utilise the services of B.Sc/GNM qualified nurses, final-year GNM or B.Sc (Nursing) students under appropriate guidance," the affidavit said.</p>

<p>The Centre has said services of allied health care professionals have also been planned based on their training and certification.</p>

<p>"States are also being provided with requisite financial support under the National Health Mission, the State Disaster Response Fund and the India COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Package," it said.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that so far as oxygen requirement is concerned, fortunately there is no crisis situation in view of the recent declining trajectory of active cases," the affidavit said.</p>

<p>It said the Centre has already commenced efforts to augment oxygen production as mentioned in a previous affidavit filed in the apex court.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court had on May 6 constituted a National Task Force on Oxygen in a separate matter, according to affidavit.</p>

<p>"The recommendations of the said task force have been received and most of the said recommendations were already under implementation on a war footing," it said.</p>

<p>The affidavit said that recent media reports regarding incidents of unauthorised or fake vaccination drives have come to the notice of the Centre.</p>

<p>"States/ UTs have been directed vide letter dated June 25, 2021, to promptly investigate any alleged irregularities and take suitable action, wherever necessary. It is submitted that any valid vaccination can only be through Co-WIN platform," it said.</p>

<p>The apex court, in its May 31 order, had raised a slew of questions while hearing the suo motu case.</p>]]></story>

<title>Sachin Waze collected Rs 4.7-crore from bar owners, handed over to Anil Deshmukh aide: ED</title>

<description><![CDATA[Waze  informed the bar owners and managers that this money  quot;will go to No.1 and crime branch and social service branch of Mumbai Police quot;.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: Suspended police officer Sachin Waze has told the ED that he "collected" Rs 4.70 crore cash from Mumbai bar owners and "handed it over" to the personal assistant of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, the central probe agency claimed on Saturday.</p>

<p>It also claimed that Waze, the former head of crime intelligence unit (CIU) of Mumbai police, informed the bar owners and managers that this money "will go to No.1 and crime branch and social service branch of Mumbai Police".</p>

<p>He further told the agency that "he was getting direct instructions from Anil Deshmukh, the then home minister in a number of police investigations".</p>

<p>The ED made these allegations in its remand application field before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Mumbai seeking custody of Deshmukh's aides, personal secretary Sanjeev Palande (51) and personal assistant Kundan Shinde (45) whom it had arrested early on Saturday.</p>

<p>The court sent them to ED custody till July 1.</p>

<p>The ED had arrested them after it raided multiple locations in Nagpur, Mumbai and Ahmedabad including the residences of Deshmukh in a money laundering case related to an alleged multi-crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to his resignation in April.</p>

<p>The former cop recorded his statement with the ED saying he was "called for a meeting at the official residence of Maharashtra home minister wherein he was given a list of bar and restaurant owners."</p>

<p>In the meeting, Waze said, he was asked "to collect Rs 3 lakh per month from each bar and restaurant."</p>

<p>"Waze has also stated that he had collected approx. Rs 4.70 crore from various bar owners between the months of December, 2020 to February, 2021 and handed over the same to Kundan Sambhaji Shinde, the PA of Anil Deshmukh, the home minister on instruction of Anil Deshmukh in two installments in the month of January and February 2021," the ED alleged.</p>

<p>The agency said it questioned and recorded the statement of Waze twice at the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai where he is in custody in connection with a case of alleged parking of an explosives laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence in Mumbai.</p>

<p>This Rs 4.70 crore was collected from various orchestra bar owners and managers for "smooth functioning of their bars after restricted hours without the restrictions of performance artist" and interference by the police, the ED said.</p>

<p>The ED said Waze's statement was "further confirmed" by two police officers who were also questioned by it.</p>

<p>"They categorically mentioned that they were told by Waze about collection of money from various bar owners and both were called by Palande, the PS of Anil Deshmukh who inquired about number of bars and collections from the various bars," the ED claimed.</p>

<p>The agency claimed that a part of this alleged cash bribe money was sent through hawala to four "paper" or shell companies located in Delhi that later "diverted" about Rs 4.</p>

<p>18 crore funds "in garb of donations" to a Nagpur based charitable trust whose chairman is Deshmukh.</p>

<p>The ED said during the scrutiny of bank statements of the charitable trust identified as Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha "a number of cheque entries in the recent past amounting to Rs 4.18 crore" were received by it from four Delhi-based shell companies.</p>

<p>The owners of these alleged fake companies told ED that they were contacted by a Nagpur based person seeking transfer/adjustment of funds in garb of donation to the said charitable trust.</p>

<p>"Money was received in form of cash from said (Nagpur based) person on instruction of Deshmukh family and same was channelised through web of various companies to the said trust in garb of loans/donations."</p>

<p>"A total of about Rs 4.18 crore were thus diverted to the said trust in garb of loans or donations," the ED said quoting the statements of the promoters Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Jain.</p>

<p>It is apparent, the ED said, that Deshmukh "by virtue of his earlier position as home minister of Maharashtra government has received amounts to the tune of Rs 4.70 crore from the orchestra bars owners and managers for smooth functioning of bars and the said bribe money was apparently used by him through his son Hrishikesh Deshmukh for providing cash to Delhi based paper companies and after layering the same routed to the charitable trust in the form of donation," the agency alleged.</p>

<p>It said Shinde was "instrumental in collecting cash from Waze on behalf of Deshmukh."</p>

<p>Describing the role of Palande, the ED alleged, he was "instrumental in passing instructions of Deshmukh with regard to transfer, postings and collection of monies from orchestra bar owners and further analysing and assessing the work of collection of tainted monies through police officials and assisted Deshmukh in money laundering."</p>

<p>It said both the aides of Deshmukh have emerged as "important cogs in the wheels" of this case and they have also "received money in cash."</p>

<p>The ED told the court that as an allegation of collection of about Rs 100 crore have been made in this case the entire money trail requires to be established in order to bring the guilty to the book.</p>

<p>"The involvement of foreign angle many not be ruled out at this stage," it said.</p>

<p>The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI first carried out a preliminary inquiry followed by a regular case being filed on the orders of the Bombay High Court.</p>

<p>The court had asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the allegations of bribery of Rs 100 made against Deshmukh by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.</p>]]></story>

<title>BJP candidates to win unopposed in 17 districts in zila panchayat chairperson polls; SP alleges foul play by officials</title>

<description><![CDATA[Akhilesh Yadav alleged that the local authorities at the behest of the BJP govt stopped SP candidates from filing nominations in many districts.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">LUCKNOW: With no other candidates filing nominations on Saturday -- the last day to submit papers -- the ruling BJP candidates are set for being elected unopposed to the Zila Panchayat chairperson posts in at least 17 out of the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh.</p>

<p>With no other candidates filing nominations and in some districts, the nomination papers of the opposition candidates were rejected by the district election authorities, the BJP candidates are set to be elected unopposed in at least 17 districts.</p>

<p>The BJP candidates are assured of triumph unopposed in CM Yogi Adityanath’s native district Gorakhpur, Ghaziabad, Lalitpur, Moradabad, Bulandshahar, Saharanpur, Amroha, Gonda, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Chitrakoot, Jhansi, Meerut, Mau, Agra, Sharwasti, Balrampur and Banda. </p>

<p>Ex-chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, however, alleged that the local authorities at the behest of the BJP government stopped SP candidates from filing nominations in many districts, including CM’s native district Gorakhpur. “Let the BJP get their candidates elected unopposed through use of official machinery, but the people of the state will ensure that the BJP isn’t able to win in 2022 assembly polls, even those many seats that it claims to have won in the district panchayat chairperson polls,” Yadav tweeted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a significant development, the Mayawati-led BSP candidates remained away from the nomination process, despite being in decisive numbers in some districts, consequently helping the BJP candidates to win unopposed.</p>

<p>In Mau district, where BSP had maximum seven elected district panchayat members where as the BJP merely had two district panchayat members, the BJP candidate Manoj Rai is set to be elected unopposed as district panchayat chairperson, as the BSP didn’t field any of its district panchayat members as candidate for the July 3 chairperson polls.</p>

<p>In Ghaziabad district also, the BSP didn’t field it's candidate, despite having significant numbers of district panchayat members.</p>

<p>In Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency Varanasi district, where only BJP and SP candidates are in fray, the BJP and SP candidates have demanded rejection of rival candidate nomination papers, citing technical flaws in the papers.</p>]]></story>

<title>SC to hear on June 28 plea against its verdict on states power to declare Backward Classes</title>

<description><![CDATA[A five-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan will hear the Centre #39;s plea in chambers.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on June 28 the Centre's plea seeking review of the May 5 majority verdict which held that 102nd Constitution amendment took away states' power to declare Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) for grant of quota in jobs and admissions.</p>

<p>A five-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan will hear the Centre's plea in chambers.</p>

<p>The bench, comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, will also hear Centre's applications in which it has sought open court hearing in the matter and stay of the majority verdict on the limited aspect of the amendment, till the plea is decided.</p>

<p>On May 13, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment issued a press release saying that the Centre has filed a review petition against the May 5 verdict of the top court.</p>

<p>The Centre has maintained that the amendment did not take away the power of the state governments to identify and declare SEBC and the two provisions which were inserted did not violated the federal structure.</p>

<p>On May 5, a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had unanimously set aside Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas and had refused to refer 1992 Mandal verdict putting a cap of 50 per cent on reservation to a larger bench.</p>

<p>The bench in its 3:2 majority verdict had ruled that 102nd Constitution amendment, which also led to setting up of National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), gives exclusive power to the Centre to identify and declare SEBC as only President can notify the list.</p>

<p>All the five judges of the bench, however, had held the amendment as valid and said it did not affect the federal polity or violate the basic structure of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The 102nd Constitution amendment Act of 2018 inserted Articles 338B, which deals with the structure, duties and powers of the NCBC, and 342A which deals with power of the president to notify a particular caste as SEBC and power of Parliament to change the list.</p>

<p>The Centre in its plea has said that majority verdict had upheld the validity of Article 342A but in doing so, the bench has interpreted that the provision denudes the states from exercising the power which they undoubtedly have for identifying and declaring SEBC in their respective states.</p>

<p>The majority verdict was rendered by Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, while the minority verdict was of Justice Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer, who said that under the constitution amendment both Centre and states have power to declare and identify SEBC.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that the minority of two judges, including presiding judge, has expressly held that Article 342A does not have in any manner deprive states of their power and jurisdiction and competence to identify and declare the socially and educationally backward classes, which is the correct interpretation of Article 342A of the Constitution," the plea has said.</p>

<p>The review plea sought direction of the top court for staying the finding and observations made in the majority verdict to the extent that Article 342A and the other provisions inserted by the 102nd Constitution amendment would denude the states of their power to identify and declare SEBC.</p>

<p>The Centre has further said that the finding and observations made in the majority verdict be stayed so that the powers of the states to identify the SEBC, which always existed is not taken away in the absence of any express provision to that effect in the Constitution.</p>

<p>Justice S Ravindra Bhat had written 132-page long verdict and Justices L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta, in their separate judgements, concurred with Justice Bhat and his reasoning in holding that states have lost their power to identify SEBC under their territory after 102nd Constitutional amendment.</p>

<p>Writing the majority judgement on this aspect, Justice Bhat had said, By introduction of Articles 366 (26C) and 342A through the 102nd Constitution, the President alone, to the exclusion of all other authorities, is empowered to identify SEBCs and include them in a list to be published under Article 342A (1), which shall be deemed to include SEBCs in relation to each state and union territory for the purposes of the Constitution".</p>

<p>Justice Bhat had opined that the states can, through their existing mechanisms, or even statutory commissions, can only make suggestions to the President or the Commission, for "inclusion, exclusion or modification of castes or communities" in the SEBC list.</p>

<p>"The states' power to make reservations, in favour of particular communities or castes, the quantum of reservations, the nature of benefits and the kind of reservations, and all other matters falling within the ambit of Articles 15 and 16 - except with respect to identification of SEBCs, remains undisturbed," the judgement, endorsed by two other judges had said.</p>

<p>"Article 342A of the Constitution by denuding states' power to legislate or classify in respect of 'any backward class of citizens' does not affect or damage the federal polity and does not violate the basic structure of the Constitution of India," Justice Bhat had said.</p>

<p>The five-judge bench have also concurred on the issue that the Maharashtra law granting 12 and 13 per cent reservation for Maratha community in addition to 50 per cent social reservation is not covered by exceptional circumstances as contemplated in Mandal judgement.</p>]]></story>

<title>ED attaches Rs 6-crore worth land in Bengal illegal coal mining PMLA case</title>

<description><![CDATA[Local state operative Anup Majhi alias Lala is alleged to be the prime suspect in the case.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: A land parcel worth Rs 6 crore in Kolkata has been attached by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with an illegal coal mining case in West Bengal, the central agency said on Saturday.</p>

<p>The case was filed under criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act by the agency after studying a November 2020 FIR of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that alleged a multi-crore coal pilferage scam related to the Eastern Coalfields Ltd's mines in the state's Kunustoria and Kajora areas in and around Asansol.</p>

<p>Local state operative Anup Majhi alias Lala is alleged to be the prime suspect in the case.</p>

<p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had claimed that the family of Trinamool Congress national general secretary and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee was a beneficiary of funds obtained from this illegal trade.</p>

<p>Abhishek Banerjee is the nephew of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.</p>

<p>The agency issued a statement here to say that the land attached by it is jointly owned by West End Pigments and Chemicals Pvt Ltd and Deshpran Properties Ltd, and it is located at Despran Shasmal Road in Kolkata.</p>

<p>The ED claimed that probe found "that an advance of Rs 6 crore for the purchase of this property was transferred from the account of LTB Infraconsultants Pvt Ltd."</p>

<p>"The source of the said fund was from proceeds of crime which was deposited in cash into the bank accounts of LTB Infraconsultants Pvt Ltd, which is owned by Vinay Mishra and Vikas Mishra," it alleged.</p>

<p>Vikas Mishra was arrested in the case earlier by the ED and he is the brother of TMC youth wing leader Vinay Mishra who is stated to have left the country sometime back and probably has also renounced his Indian citizenship.</p>

<p>The former inspector in-charge of Bankura police station, Ashok Kumar Mishra, was also arrested by the agency in the case.</p>

<p>With the latest action, the total attachment of properties in this case stands at Rs 171.86 crore.</p>

<p>The ED had earlier claimed that the Mishra brothers received "proceeds of crime worth Rs 730 crore on behalf of some influential persons and for themselves" in this case involving an estimated amount of Rs 1,352 crore.</p>

<p>A "deep system" of political patronage and a "well-oiled" machinery was used to brazenly carry out certain unlawful coal minings in West Bengal, the ED has claimed while seeking the remand of Inspector Mishra in April.</p>

<p>A chargesheet was also filed by the ED in May this year.</p>]]></story>

<title>Cracks in Assam opposition ranks as BPF skips Congress-led joint press meet</title>
<author>PTI</author>

<description><![CDATA[The allies tried to downplay the issue, claiming that the BPF leaders were absent due to  quot;some difficulty perhaps quot;.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">GUWAHATI: Less than two months after the Congress-led Grand Alliance faced defeat in the Assam Asembly polls, cracks within the multi-party opposition coalition have emerged with a major partner, Bodoland People's Front (BPF), skipping a joint press conference called by the parties here on Saturday.</p>

<p>The allies tried to downplay the issue, claiming that the BPF leaders were absent due to "some difficulty perhaps".</p>

<p>"The BPF was invited to the press conference and they had said that they would be coming," Assam Pradesh Congress Committee president Ripun Bora said.</p>

<p>"There must have been some difficulty perhaps, especially in view of the COVID-19 situation," he added.</p>

<p>All other partners AIUDF, CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML), RJD and Anchalik Gana Marcha, besides the Congress- were present at the joint press conference.</p>

<p>The BPF was a part of the last BJP-led state goverent-led alliance prior to 2016 polls.</p>

<p>However, it had parted ways with the ruling alliance towards the end of last year and had joined the Congress- headed grand alliance ahead of the polls, held in March-April this year.</p>

<p>The BPF, a major power in the Bodo belt, had been a part of the Tarun Gogoi-led governments in the state in 2006 and 2011.</p>

<p>The party, which had won 12 seats in 2016 state polls, managed to bag only four in this year election.</p>

<p>This is the first time that the BPF, founded in 2005, is not a part of the ruling coalition in the state.</p>

<p>The opposition grouping had called the press meet to highlight that the BJP-led coalition has gone back on all its major pre-poll promises.</p>

<p>"The government has gone back on all its promises, be it waiving loans from microfinance institutions or increasing daily wage of tea garden workers," the Assam PCC chief said.</p>

<p>Instead of finding ways to mitigate the problems of the people, the BJP is busy in polarising the people along religious lines, the leaders of the grand alliance claimed at a joint press conference.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union, an umbrella body of farm unions that is spearheading the agitation, said farmers will end the protest once the agri laws are repealed.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: As their agitation completed seven months, farmer leaders on Saturday stuck to their demands, saying they will call off their protest if the government repeals the three farm laws even as Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed to them to end their stir and offered to resume talks.</p>

<p>Yudhvir Singh, general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union, an umbrella body of farm unions that is spearheading the agitation, said farmers will end the protest once the agri laws are repealed.</p>

<p>"The government does talk about minimum support price. The government always talk about the amendment in the laws. However, we want them to repeal the laws. We also want them to introduce a law on MSP," Singh said.</p>

<p>Shiv Kumar Kakka, national president of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh, said they will not hold talks under any precondition.</p>

<p>"We have lost over 600 farmers in last seven months and they (government) are telling us to end this agitation. There will be no dialogue under any preconditions."</p>

<p>"If the government repeals the three farm laws and makes a new one with the guarantee of minimum support price (MSP), we will thank them and head back to our respective places," Kakka said.</p>

<p>The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest.</p>

<p>Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.</p>

<p>Jamhuri Kisan Sabha general secretary Kulwant Singh said they also want to go back home as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"The government is asking us to end the protest as they are ready for talks. We have already asked the government several times to repeal the three laws. If they do so, we will head back home as soon as possible from the borders. We do not like doing this and staying out of home for months," Singh said.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court had put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and has set up a committee to find solutions.</p>

<p>The committee has submitted its report.</p>

<p>"I want to convey through your (media) that farmers should end their agitation. Many are in favour of these new laws across the country. Still, some farmers have any issue with provisions of the laws, Government of India is ready to listen and discuss with them," Tomar tweeted on Saturday.</p>

<p>He said the government held 11 rounds of consultations with protesting farmer unions.</p>

<p>The government has increased the minimum support price (MSP) and is procuring more quantity at MSP.</p>

<p>On Saturday, hundreds of farmers from interiors of Uttar Pradesh, many of them on tractors, reached Ghazipur on Delhi's borders to mark the completion of seven months of the protest.</p>

<p>Led by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, a group of protesters submitted a memorandum of their demands at the office of DCP Northeast Delhi after a virtual meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.</p>

<p>The farmers had given a call for a protest march from Civil Lines metro station to the Raj Bhawan, a senior police officer said, adding that the Delhi Police tightened security across borders of the national capital in view of the anticipated march.</p>

<p>Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for seven months now in protest the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP.</p>

<p>Farmers' protest had started on November 26 last year and has now completed seven months notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[The Vatika aim is to promote national integration with the display of the magnificent bio-diversity of the country.  ]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">DEHRADUN: In a first in India, Uttarakhand on Saturday inaugurated 'Bharat Vatika' which has the state trees of 28 Indian provinces and five Union Territories. </p>

<p>Established in a one-acre area in Haldwani of Nainital district, the Vatika aims is to promote national integration with the display of magnificent bio-diversity of the country. </p>

<p>"Our teams' effort took more than one-and-a-half years starting before March 2020. Each and every species was collected with great efforts. The bigger task was to acclimatise, save and propagate the species for survival in Haldwani. It is collective efforts that have borne fruits. The aim of Bharat Vatika is to promote national integration with the display of magnificent bio-diversity of the country," said Chaturvedi. </p>

<p>Herculean efforts went into the procurement of all the species were taken. After getting five plants of Puddock tree from Andaman & Nicobar Island, all of the specimens died despite every effort to conserve and save. Later, seeds of the tree were arranged and plants were obtained through those after trying to grow in different nurseries of the research wing.</p>

<p>"All these species are from different climes including tropical wet, humid, arid and semi-arid regions, areas which have evergreen forests and so on. Some plants could not bear the winters here, some summers so it became a task for us to bring this reality to fruition for over 18 months now, " added Chaturvedi. </p>

<p>First such an area in the country to depict all the state trees of different states of India in one place. </p>

<p>The Vatika showcases 24 species of trees from 28 states and 5 Union Territories with some species being state trees of more than one states which include Mango (Mangifera indica) being state tree of Maharashtra and Chandigarh, Khejari (Prosopis cineraria) being a state tree of Telangana and Rajasthan, Bargad (Ficus benghalensis) being a state tree of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, Peepal (Ficus religiosa) being state tree of Bihar, Haryana, and Odisha, coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) being state tree of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Hollong (Dipterocarpus macrocarpus) being state tree of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and Sal tree which is the state tree of Chhatisgarh and Jharkhand. </p>

<p>Apart from displaying important species like Bargad which also happens to be the national tree of India, Peepal, Sita-Ashok, it also showcases Naag-Kesar (known as ironwood) which is the state tree of Mizoram, famous Chinar tree of Kashmir, Chandan from Karnataka, highly aromatic Agarwood tree from Tripura, breadroot from Lakshadweep, Alestonia from West Bengal and the famous Puddock tree of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. </p>

<p>It also has a Devadar tree from Himachal Pradesh, Rodorendran species from Uttarakhand and Sikkim, White Teak from Meghalaya and Neem, the state tree of Andhra Pradesh. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the research wing of the department, which helms the project, chose two girl students from a government school in Haldwani to inaugurate the Vatika. Khushboo Siyal and Harshita Kholia from class 12 Government Girls Intercollege, Dhaulakheda, Haldwani, inaugurated the Vatika. "This is an honour. We are overwhelmed and cannot thank enough," they said,</p>

<p>Sajiv Chaturvedi, 2002 batch Indian Forest Services officer, who heads the research wing of the state forest department, told The New Indian Express: "Mother Nature and our girl students are preservers of life as we know it today. We decided to request these children to signify this."</p>]]></story>

<title>Anil Deshmukh had received over Rs 4 crore from bar owners and channeled them to his trust: ED</title>

<description><![CDATA[The ED made this claim during the remand hearing of Deshmukh #39;s personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: The then Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh had received over Rs 4 crore from bar owners in Mumbai and channeled that money to his trust in the form of donations through various dummy companies, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) told a court here on Saturday.</p>

<p>The ED made this claim during the remand hearing of Deshmukh's personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde.</p>

<p>Palande and Shinde were arrested in connection with a money laundering related to an alleged multi-crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to Deshmukh's resignation in April, officials said, adding the duo was booked under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p>

<p>The duo was remanded in the ED custody till July 1.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Deshmukh who was asked to depose before the investigating officer at the ED office in Ballard Estate here by 11 am, sought a fresh date for appearance before the agency which had summoned him for questioning in a money laundering case.</p>

<p>A team of Deshmukh's lawyers visited the ED office and sought a fresh date for appearance.</p>

<p>They also handed over a letter written by Deshmukh to the investigators.</p>

<p>The ED told the court that Palande and Shinde were instrumental in assisting Deshmukh in money laundering.</p>

<p>The ED case against Deshmukh and others is borne out after the CBI first carried out a preliminary enquiry (PE) followed by a regular case being filed on the orders of the Bombay High Court.</p>

<p>While seeking remand of the duo, the ED told the court that some bar owners/managers said in their statements that a meeting was held by Sachin Waze, the then head of crime intelligence unit (CTU), with the bar owners at his office regarding collection of money for smooth functioning of their orchestra bars after restricted hours without any restrictions on the performance artists.</p>

<p>It can be gathered from these statements that Waze had collected Rs 4.70 crore from various orchestra bar owners across Mumbai, the ED said.</p>

<p>Later, Waze said in a statement that he used to get direct instructions from the then home minister in a number of police investigations, the ED told the court.</p>

<p>According to Waze, he was given a list of bars and restaurant owners in a meeting held at the official residence of then Maharashtra home minister, the ED said.</p>

<p>Waze said he had been asked to collect Rs.3 lakh per month from each bar and restaurant and therefore a meeting was arranged with various bar owners, the ED said, citing the sacked police officer's statement.</p>

<p>Waze has also stated that he had collected approximately Rs 4.70 crore from various bar owners between the months of December, 2020 and February, 2021, which he handed over to Kundan Shinde in two installments, the ED said.</p>

<p>Waze is currently under judicial custody in connection with the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence in south Mumbai and the subsequent murder of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran probed by the NIA.</p>

<p>The ED said it came across Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, a charitable trust, run by the Deshmukh familyduring the probe.</p>

<p>Anil Deshmukh is the chairman of this trust and his family members are trustees and members.</p>

<p>The trust is running engineering, MBA, and polytechnic colleges in Nagpur.</p>

<p>However, scrutiny of bank statements of the trust revealed that there are a number of entries of cheques amounting to approximately Rs 4.</p>

<p>18 crore in the recent past, the ED said The court was told that this amount was received by the trust from various companies based in Delhi.</p>

<p>The ED investigation has so far revealed that these companies exist only on paper and they work for providing "transfer entries".</p>

<p>During the searches conducted at four locations Delhi, it emerged that these companies are owned by Surendra Kumar Jain and his brother Virendra Jain, the ED said.</p>

<p>Their statements revealed that a person from Nagpur had contacted them and asked for transfer/adjustment entries in the garb of donation to the trust.</p>

<p>Accordingly, money was received in the form of cash from that person on the instructions of the Deshmukh family and the same was channelized through a web of companies to the trust in the garb of donations, as per the ED.</p>

<p>Approximately Rs 4.18 crore was diverted to the trust in the garb of loans/donations, the ED said.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, it is apparent that Deshmukh by virtue of his earlier position as state home minister had received amounts to the tune of approx Rs 4.70 crore from the orchestra bars owners and the amount was apparently used by him through his son Hrishikesh for providing the cash to Delhi-based (on) paper companies. After layering, the same (money) was routed to the Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha Trust in the form of donation," the anti-money laundering agency said.</p>

<p>The ED's probe until now also revealed that there are 11 companies which are directly controlled by family members Anil Deshmukh.</p>

<p>Further, another set of 13 companies are in the names of close associates of the Deshmukh family.</p>

<p>From the analysis of accounts of these companies it is clear that there is no rationale for transfers and it can thus be said that these series of transactions were meant for inflating the balance sheets and layering of money from one company to the other, the ED said.</p>

<p>The ED also stated it is apparent that Kundan Shinde is instrumental in collecting cash from Waze on the behalf of Deshmukh and assisted him in laundering the money.</p>

<p>Further, it has also emerged that Palande was instrumental in passing on the instructions of Deshmukh in regards to transfer, postings and collection of money from orchestra bars (to police officers).</p>

<p>As per the ED, Palande also played a role in analyzing and assessing the work of collection of tainted money through police officers.</p>

<p>Shinde and Palande had also received the money in the form of cash which needed to be investigated further, the ED said, adding Shinde and Palande were directly involved in the offence of money laundering.</p>

<p>Their custodial interrogation is the need of the hour in the interest of the ongoing investigation, the ED said.</p>

<p>The allegation of collection of about Rs 100 crore was made in this case.</p>

<p>The entire money trail requires to be established in order to bring the guilty to book, it added.</p>

<p>The probe agency said the involvement of a foreign angle may not be ruled out at this stage.</p>

<p>The ED said Shinde and Palande have emerged as the important cog in the wheels and it is therefore imperative for the investigation to interrogate the duo in order to draw a logical conclusion in this case, it added.</p>

<p>In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the post of Mumbai police commissioner, IPS officer Param Bir Singh had alleged that Deshmukh, state home minister at that time, had directed dismissed policeman Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore per month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.</p>

<p>The ED case against Deshmukh and others is borne out after the CBI first carried out a preliminary enquiry (PE), followed by the filing of a regular case on the orders of the Bombay High Court.</p>

<p>The CBI had booked Deshmukh and others under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to criminal conspiracy and the Prevention of Corruption Act for "attempt to obtain undue advantage for the improper and dishonest performance of public duty".</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Rajasthan on Friday confirmed its first case of the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus in a 65-year-old woman from Bikaner, who had received both doses of the vaccine against Covid, according to a news18.com report. </p>

<p>The woman had already recovered from the Covid infection and had received both shots of Covaxin. She was asymptomatic and had recovered following treatment, the report said.</p>

<p>“The patient’s sample was sent to NIV on May 31 and after 25 days, the state government received the reports which were then sent to Bikaner district collector for further action,” Bikaner’s PBM Hospital Superintendent Parmendra Sirohi was quoted as saying in the report.</p>

<p>Bikaner CMHO OP Chahar said: “Special instructions have been issued for tracing in and around the residence of the woman. All those people who tested positive in the area in the last one month will be tested again.” </p>

<p>The sample of the woman was sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune on May 30 for genome sequencing and her test report came on Friday. The CMHO said the sampling will be conducted on Saturday in the Bangla Nagar area where the woman lives.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, CM Ashok Gehlot said his government is taking this issue seriously. There will be no laxity in services and the new guidelines will ensure that the Delta Plus variant does not spread across the state, the CM further said.</p>]]></story>

<title>Johnson &amp; Johnson's COVID vaccine could be available in private hospitals in India next month</title>

<description><![CDATA[The advantage of this vaccine is that it requires only a single shot and can be stored in regular refrigerators for up to three months]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: The COVID-19 vaccine by the US-based Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary Janssen could be available in private hospitals in India next month in a limited quantity for about Rs 2,000 per dose, if efforts by the body of a private hospital association work out.</p>

<p>The advantage of this viral vector-based vaccine is that it requires only a single shot and can be stored in regular refrigerators for up to three months.</p>

<p>The price of this vaccine is $25 per dose or Rs 1855 while private hospitals will also charge administrative cost of Rs 150, apart from GST, for every dose administered.</p>

<p>As per the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, this vaccine was 66.3% effective in efficacy trials at preventing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection and people had the most protection two weeks after getting vaccinated.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/jun/26/soon-you-may-avail-covid-vaccine-at-your-doctors-clinic-next-door-2321866.html" target="_blank">Soon, you may avail Covid vaccine at your doctor's clinic next door</a></strong></p>

<p>“We are trying to procure this vaccine for some private hospitals in India and the idea is to establish and verify a supply channel for this vaccine in India before the vaccine can be imported in a big way,” said Girdhar J Gyani, director general of the Association of Private Healthcare Providers in India.</p>

<p>He said that the vaccine may be particularly apt for India, given that it is a single dose vaccine and can be stored easily.</p>

<p>“These two features make it useful for a large chunk of population in tier II and III cities and remote parts in the country,” Gyani added.</p>

<p>Recently, the Indian government had relaxed regulatory norms to allow foreign made COVID-19 vaccines — approved by developed countries and the WHO — to enter India without the mandatory bridging clinical trials.</p>

<p>It had tweaked norms to mandate that the vaccine batches cleared by regulators abroad will not need additional clearing by the Central Drugs Laboratories, Kasauli, as has been the norm for all drugs and vaccines till now.</p>

<p>The AHPI has also been trying to procure J&J COVID jabs through an authorised private agency in India from the European Union's quota for lower- and middle-income countries.</p>

<p>In the US, the pharma major J&J meanwhile had recently announced that it is testing whether the immune response from its vaccine is capable of neutralizing the delta variant of SARS CoV 2 in a laboratory setting but data from the experiment is yet to be available.</p>

<p>The results from the tests will be highly relevant for India where the delta variant is now the most dominant strain of the COVID virus.</p>

<title>Those alleging corruption in Ayodhya land deal should approach court if they have evidence: VHP</title>

<description><![CDATA[VHP #39;s joint general secretary Surendra Jain Saturday said the Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust conducted the land deal with  quot;utmost honesty and transparency quot;.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) Saturday said those alleging corruption in a land deal by the Ram temple trust in Ayodhya should approach the court if they have any evidence to prove their claim.</p>

<p>AAP leader Sanjay Singh and former SP MLA from Ayodhya Pawan Pandey had recently alleged that a piece of land worth Rs 2 crore was purchased by the Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust in Ayodhya at an inflated price of Rs 18.5 crore.</p>

<p>Dismissing the allegations as "baseless", VHP's joint general secretary Surendra Jain Saturday said the Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust conducted the land deal with "utmost honesty and transparency".</p>

<p>"There is no scam in it. If there is anything wrong, why don't they go to court? They should move the court if they have any evidence," he told reporters here, lashing out at the Aam Aadmi Party, the Samajwadi Party, the Congress and other opposition parties which have been demanding a probe into the deal.</p>

<p>Singh and Pandey had alleged money laundering in the deal, and demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).</p>

<p>The Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust's general secretary Champat Rai strongly dismissed the allegations, claiming the land was purchased at a price much lower than the prevailing market rate.</p>

<p>AAP Rajya Sabha member Singh told the media last week that he was preparing to take the matter to court.</p>

<p>"We are still waiting for that. Why haven't they approached the court so far? They should do it. Truth will come out before everybody," the VHP general secretary said.</p>

<p>A political row has erupted on the alleged financial irregularity in the purchase of land for Ram temple premises, with several opposition parties including Congress demanding a probe into it.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">BHOPAL: With Madhya Pradesh recording a steady decline in COVID-19 cases, the state government has decided to lift the "corona curfew" on Sundays, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Saturday.</p>

<p>With nine new cases, Indore's caseload went up to 1,52,814, while Bhopal's tally rose to 1,23,095 after 11 persons tested positive for the infection.</p>

<p>Indore reported five casualties, taking its toll to 1,390, Bhopal's toll stands at 972 with no new fatalities, it was stated.</p>

<p>With this, Indore is now left with 160 active cases, while Bhopal has 227 patients undergoing treatment, the official said, adding that the state is now left with 927 active cases.</p>

<p>As many as 68,915 swab samples were tested during the day, taking the total number of tests conducted in the state to over 1.18 crore.</p>

<p>Coronavirus figures in MP are as follows: Total cases 7,89,657, new cases 46, death toll 8,896, recovered 7,79,834, active cases 927, number of tests so far 1,18,04,713.</p>]]></story>

<title>Stuck in traffic during President visit, UP woman dies of post-Covid complications</title>

<description><![CDATA[On reaching the hospital, the doctors declared her dead and said she could well have been saved had she been brought in time.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>LUCKNOW: Stuck in traffic following diversions to facilitate the ongoing visit of President Ram Nath Kovind, the 50-year-old local chairperson of the women wing of the Indian Industries Association (IIA) died due to post-Covid complications in UP's Kanpur on Friday. </p>

<p>While apologizing over Twitter for the tragic incident, the Kanpur Police Commissioner has ordered an investigation into the incident and four cops, including a sub-inspector and three constables, have been suspended. The probe ordered by the Kanpur Police Commissioner Asim Arun will be done by ADCP (Kanpur South). </p>

<p>According to sources, Vandana Mishra, a resident of Kidwai Nagar, was infected with Covid in April, but nearly two months after testing negative for the viral infection, she was still experiencing post-Covid complications, owing to which she had to be taken to hospital on multiple occasions since then. </p>

<p>“On Friday afternoon she went for some clinical examinations and tests at the hospital and returned at around 4.30 pm. But a couple of hours after returning home, she started complaining of nausea and other health problems, after which her kin took her in their car to a premier hospital. On the way to the hospital, the vehicle got stuck in traffic near the GovindPuri flyover. With her condition becoming critical, her kin, who included a doctor, tried to revive her. On reaching the hospital, the doctors declared her dead and added that had she been brought in time to the hospital, she could well have been saved,” an IIA-Kanpur office-bearer said.   </p>

<p>A senior Kanpur Police Commissionerate officer said the traffic was diverted or stopped at various places as the Special Presidential Train was to pass through the concerned area of Kanpur City. </p>

<p>The President is on a three-day visit to Kanpur since Friday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Kanpur Police Commissioner Asim Arun in a tweet apologised for the incident, “Personally as well as on behalf of the Kanpur City Police, I apologize for the tragic incident. It has been a major lesson for the future, we take a vow that the route arrangements in future in such situations will be such that commoners are stopped for a minimum possible time to prevent reoccurrence of such tragic incidents.” </p>

<p>In another tweet, Arun wrote: “The Honourable President has expressed his condolences on the untimely death of sister Vandana Mishra.  The Kanpur Police Commissioner and the District Magistrate were called by him (the President), where he inquired from them about the incident and conveyed condolences to the bereaved family. Both the senior officers attended the funeral and conveyed the President’s message to the bereaved family.” </p>

<p>The mortal remains of Vandana Mishra were consigned to flames at the electric crematorium in Kanpur on Saturday. Her kin didn’t speak to the media about the incident.<br />

<title>Farmers' protests: MP activists allege house arrest, cops deny charge</title>

<description><![CDATA[Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh national convener Shiv Kumar Sharma  #39;Kakkaji #39; told PTI that police was deployed outside his house at around 8:30am with the intention of keeping him inside.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">BHOPAL: Several activists planning to mark the completion of seven months of farm protests against the Centre's three new laws on Saturday claimed they were held under house arrest in Madhya Pradesh, an allegation refuted by police authorities.</p>

<p>Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh national convener Shiv Kumar Sharma 'Kakkaji' told PTI that police was deployed outside his house at around 8:30am with the intention of keeping him inside.</p>

<p>"They did not tell me about house arrest but I gauged that their intention was to keep me inside the house. Several colleagues told me the situation was similar at their homes with police remaining present outside. At 12:30pm, a delegation was allowed to submit a memorandum at a government office," Sharma said.</p>

<p>In a statement, Badal Saroj of Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha said over 100 activists and farmers, including Medha Patkar and Dr Sunilam of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, were held under house arrest till 4pm at Gandhi Bhawan.</p>

<p>The statement claimed police allowed just five people to submit a memorandum of their demands after much insistence from activists and farmers present.</p>

<p>"But the delegation was not allowed to enter Raj Bhawan by the police and had to return from the gate," Saroj said.</p>

<p>Refuting the allegations, Bhopal Range Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) A Sai Manohar told PTI that none of the activists were kept under house arrest.</p>

<p>"There was no agitation possible in the pandemic due to protocol. If they were arrested, how could the activists reach the gate of Raj Bhawan? Nobody was placed under house arrest," he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sharma said, after Mission Bengal, protesting farmers will also take part in the Uttar Pradesh polls scheduled to be held next year.</p>

<p>Adding that they will not campaign for any party but will make people aware of the anti-people nature of the three agri marketing laws passed by the Centre.</p>

<p>He claimed mustard oil prices have gone up from Rs 70 per litre to Rs 200 per litre due to these new laws that allow traders and corporates to hoard limitless quantities.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Modi government has been harassing farmers not just for the last seven months of their protest against the three farm laws, but since it came to power seven years ago, the Congress alleged on Saturday.</p>

<p>Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also posed a set of seven questions to the central government, asking whether it was working on a policy to "tire and drive away, harass and defeat, defame and divide" the protesting farmers by conspiring against them.</p>

<p>The protest against the laws by farmers camping at various Delhi border points began in November last year and they are demanding that the legislations be withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Even though farmers are sitting on an agitation since November last year, the Modi government has been conspiring to harass them for the last seven years ever since it came to power in 2014 by bringing the Land Acquisition Act to take away their land," Surjewala said.</p>

<p>Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has appealed to protesting farmers to end their agitation, saying the government is ready to resume talks on the provisions of three legislations, which were enacted in September last year.</p>

<p>The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the protest.</p>

<p>Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the laws till further orders and has set up a committee to find solutions, and it has already submitted its report.</p>

<p>The Congress spokesperson alleged that the increase in prices of farm inputs and rise in diesel price are aimed at making farming unremunerative so that farmers sell their land.</p>

<p>He claimed that the government has taken a number of steps against farmers and these include reducing minimum support price (MSP) of crops, brouging farm insurance to benefit insurance firms, imposing Goods and Services Tax on farm inputs like fertilisers, pesticides, tractors, drips and sprinklers, and then bringing the three "black" farm laws, which are all aimed at breaking the market to benefit capitalists.</p>

<p>"On one hand (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji pretends to give Rs 6,000 annually and on the other hand, takes out Rs 20,000 per hectare from the pockets of farmers by increasing the cost of farming," he said.</p>

<p>Posing the seven questions to the government, Surjewala asked whether the Cost and Price Commission in its Kharif Report for 2021-22 has said the government keeps the sample size too small to calculate cost and this leads to incorrect cost price.</p>

<p>"Has the government not shut down grain markets continuously ever since the three black laws were implemented," he asked.</p>

<p>Is not the farmer free to sell his crop anywhere in the country outside 'mandis' and if this is true, then what is the need of the three laws, Surjewala asked.</p>

<p>"Hasn't hoarding stopped ever since the three agri laws have been suspended for implementation ? Then why does the Modi government want to give exemption to hoarders by implementing the three black laws that promote hoarding," the Congress leader asked.</p>

<p>Is the government not working on a policy to "tire and drive away, harass and defeat, defame and divide farmers by conspiring against them", the Congress leader asked.</p>]]></story>

<title>Fake vaccination camps: Suvendu Adhikari writes to Harsh Vardhan for CBI probe</title>
<author>PTI</author>

<description><![CDATA[In his letter, Adhikari alleged that the man, who was arrested after his drive was busted by the police, has  quot;influence in the ruling party quot;.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">KOLKATA: Leader of Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly Suvendu Adhikari has sought a probe by the central agencies into fake vaccination drive in the city conducted by a man impersonating as an IAS officer having "influence in the ruling party."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The BJP leader made the demand for central probe in a letter written to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.</p>

<p>In his letter, Adhikari alleged that the man, who was arrested after his drive was busted by the police, has "influence in the ruling party".</p>

<p>He claimed that Debanjan Deb, the main accused, held illegal vaccination camps in Kasba, Amherst Street and Sonarpur areas under the "watch of the local administration, including police and civic authorities".</p>

<p>"Hundreds of people have already been inoculated in these camps. While copies of Aadhaar cards were procured from the recipients in Kasba, none of them received any certificate of vaccination."</p>

<p>"The big question is - were these shots really Covishield vaccines as being claimed by the accused? If so, then this raises a big question on pilferage of COVID vaccines from the government stock and this cannot happen without complicity of top civic authorities."</p>

<p>"If these were not COVID vaccines, then immediate investigation needs to be done," Adhikari said in the letter written on Friday.</p>

<p>The Kolkata Police arrested Deb (28) Wednesday for allegedly posing as an IAS officer and organising a COVID-19 vaccination camp in Kasba area, and formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by the joint police commissioner (Crime).</p>

<p>The SIT will investigate how the main accused held COVID-19 vaccination camps where around 2000 people were suspected to have been administered fake doses,a senior officer had said.</p>

<p>Actor and Trinamool Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty, who had taken COVID vaccine shot at one of the camps set up by Deb,was first to raise the alarm as she did not receive the customary SMS that is sent to people after they have taken the jab.</p>

<p>"Public health frauds like this in the midst of a raging global pandemic are making common people skeptic. I sincerely urge you to order a thorough investigation by concerned central agencies into this vaccination fraud and punish the guilty."</p>

<p>"An impartial investigation by the central agencies, undaunted by any pressure from the state's ruling party or the government, is the need of the hour to restore credibility of the entire COVID vaccination process in West Bengal," Adhikari wrote to the union health minister.</p>

<p>The incident triggered a political storm after purported photographs and videos of the arrested person along with several TMC leaders and ministers at various programmes came in the public domain.</p>

<p>PTI could not independently verify the authenticity of the photographs or videos.</p>

<p>Adhikari claimed that the main accused held illegal vaccination camps decorated with "trademark blue and white balloons characteristic of the TMC government events".</p>

<p>"While Kolkata Police has reportedly started investigating into the fraud, several incriminating photos suggestive of the accused's influence in the ruling party of West Bengal have come to the fore," the BJP leader alleged.</p>

<p>The TMC leadership, however, has denied any involvement in the matter.</p>

<p>"We are politicians and attend several programmes every day. Many people come to us and click pictures. It is not always possible to ascertain their identity. The allegations against our leaders are baseless and politically motivated," senior TMC leader and minister Firhad Hakim said.</p>

<p>After its defeat in the assembly polls, the BJP was looking for an issue to corner the TMC government and is quick to grab it and demanded a CBI probe to look into the matter, Hakim said.</p>

<p>"If just a photograph proves someone guilty, several BJP leaders should be put behind the bars for having photographed with the scamsters," senior TMC leader Tapas Ray has said.</p>

<p>Adhikari on Friday led a BJP delegation to Swasthya Bhawan, the state health department headquarters, and questioned officials how a person impersonating as an IAS officer has been organising vaccination camps remained off the radar of the police and the department for so long.</p>

<p>He had also claimed that it was a conspiracy of the TMC as the ruling party in West Bengal was trying to tarnish the BJP-led Union government image with a claim that the Centre has provided fake vaccines.</p>

<p>"We apprehend that the West Bengal government and the ruling party have hatched a larger conspiracy to implicate the Centre.</p>

<p>They are helping people with disputable identity to organise camps where fake jabs were administered to defame the Narendra Modi regime.</p>

<p>"If there was any adverse impact on people who were inoculated, the TMC will blame the Centre for providing fake vaccines," the BJP leader had said.</p>

<p>According to police officials,Deb allegedly had financially duped several people in Kolkata by impersonating as a joint commissioner of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC).</p>

<p>On his social media accounts, he had posted several pictures of organising medical camps and participating in government programmes.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[The signatories, 10 of whom have served as state DGPs, said the complete integration of Kashmir with the Union of India was an unfinished task since the Constitution was adopted in 1950.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Fifteen retired IPS officers Saturday wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lauding him for his government's "courageous and decisive" efforts to resolve the complex Kashmir issue, and termed "exemplary" the recent initiative by the Centre to reach out to political stakeholders there.</p>

<p>The signatories, 10 of whom have served as state DGPs, said the complete integration of Kashmir with the Union of India was an unfinished task since the Constitution was adopted in 1950.</p>

<p>The Modi government's "painstaking, courageous and decisive efforts" at attempting to resolve the complex Kashmir issue have been noticed ever since the Modi dispensation came to power seven years ago, they added.</p>

<p>"It is a matter of national pride that over these years, the central government tried all means possible to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>"The momentous decision to annul Article 35A and read-down Article 370, was efficiently implemented, with all necessary precautions to prevent the loss of life and property," the letter said.</p>

<p>Now, a citizen of Kashmir can proudly call himself or herself Indian and receive all benefits that the Indian State bestows on its citizens, it said.</p>

<p>The retired police officers also said it is a matter of great satisfaction that the government's ability to foresee future events and to plan for all kinds of possibilities led to tight control over crime, terrorism and public order since August 5, 2019, when the Article 370, giving special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was abrogated and the erstwhile state was divided into two Union Territories.</p>

<p>They said the implementation of the plan was impeccable, given that Pakistan, the "permanent interloper" in matters regarding Kashmir, was boxed into a difficult position, given its earlier stand of non-recognition of Article 370.</p>

<p>"Of more interest is the fact that Pakistan is now calling for the reinstatement of Statehood for Jammu and Kashmir, which amounts to accepting Jammu and Kashmir as part of the Union of India," they said.</p>

<p>The retired police officers also appreciated the manner in which the government organised an impeccable system of managing external pressures such as those from western nations and multilateral bodies like the United Nation, which, they said, had been interfering in India's internal affairs regarding Kashmir for several decades.</p>

<p>"None of these external elements were able to create any significant impact, except the appearance of articles in media of choice. Almost two years have elapsed and the seal of integration with the Union is absolute," they said.</p>

<p>The Central government's most recent initiative at reaching out to political stakeholders and countering the twin elements of "Dil ki doori" and "Dilli ki doori", in order to enhance trust, is exemplary, reflecting a dynamic approach to policy-making, the letter said.</p>

<p>"We are hopeful that you will fulfil your promise of bringing economic development to Jammu and Kashmir, with all the robust investment plans that have been finalised," they said.</p>

<p>The signatories include AK Singh (IPS, Gujarat, 1985), Badri Prasad Singh (IPS, Uttar Pradesh, 1990), Geeta Johri (IPS, Gjaurat, 1982), K Aravinda Rao (IPS, AP, 1977), K Rajendra Kumar (IPS, JK, 1984), KB Singh (IPS, Odisha, 1985),M Nageswara Rao (IPS, Odisha, 1986), PP Pandey (IPS, Gujarat, 1982), Prakash Mishra (IPS, Odisha, 1977).</p>

<p>Prime Minister Modi Thursday held an all-party meeting on Jammu and Kashmir where he said the ongoing delimitation exercise there has to happen quickly so that polls can be held to form an elected government that gives strength to its development trajectory.</p>

<p>The prime minister had also said he wanted to remove ''Dilli ki Duri as well as ''Dil Ki Duri'' (distance from Delhi as well as distance of hearts), according to the sources.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Preparation for the assembly polls in five states early next year was the main agenda of a meeting of senior BJP leaders, including several Union ministers, on Saturday as they deliberated on political and governance issues linked to these states.</p>

<p>Party president J P Nadda and Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Narendra Singh Tomar, Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal and Dharmendra Pradhan were among those who attended the meeting, party leaders said.</p>

<p>"Preparation for the assembly polls in five states was the main agenda of the meeting," a party leader said after the meeting.</p>

<p>Union ministers Pralhad Joshi, Mansukh Mandaviya and Hardeep Singh Puri, besides BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav and its vice president Baijyant Jay Panda also attended the meeting.</p>

<p>Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa are slated for early next year.</p>

<p>The BJP is in power in all these states except Punjab, and has been holding a series of meetings of its senior leaders as it works to put up an impressive show in the next round of elections.</p>

<p>In the meeting, party leaders also took stock of various development works going on in these states as the BJP leadership has often stressed on the need for coordination among different ministries and the party organisation in an effort to factor in the feedback, sources said.</p>

<p>Uttar Pradesh is especially crucial to the BJP's political fortunes as the party has been the dominant power in the country's most populous state since Prime Minister Narendra Modi led it to power at the Centre in 2014.</p>

<p>The ruling party leaders have been holding deliberations for weeks over a number of political and governance issues.</p>]]></story>

<title>Centre opposes in SC pleas for ex-gratia compensation to families of Covid victims, says using resources rationally</title>
<author>PTI</author>
<source>PTI</source>
<pubDate>Saturday, June 26, 2021 08:14 PM +0530</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[It said the guidelines, meant for 2015 to 2020, recommended expenditure for providing financial relief against 12 specific identified disasters on the national level.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: The Centre has told the Supreme Court that though there was no issue of "fiscal affordability" with it, but ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the families of those who have died of Covid cannot be paid keeping in mind the "rational, judicious and optimum usage of resources of the nation".</p>

<p>The Centre's additional affidavit has been filed in pursuance of the direction of the apex court which, on June 21, had reserved its verdict on two PILs seeking ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh to the dependents of those who died of Covid and easing the procedures for issuance of death certificates to these victims specifying the pandemic as the reason of demise.</p>

<p>Terming Covid as "once in a lifetime pandemic inflicted on the entire world", the Centre, in the 39-page written submission, said various steps to strategise the nation's response to the pandemic have been taken and not just the funds of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), but even the funds of Consolidated Fund of India are being utilised according to advice of experts.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that, as specifically pleaded before this Hon'ble Court, the issue is not of fiscal affordability, but rather of the most rational, judicious and optimum usage of fiscal and all other resources of the nation," the Centre said.</p>

<p>It said the guidelines, meant for 2015 to 2020, recommended expenditure for providing financial relief against 12 specific identified disasters on the national level that is "cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloudburst, pest-attack, frost and cold wave" and the COVID-19 is not included.</p>

<p>"Additionally, the respective state government had been given the flexibility to use up to 10 percent of annual allocation under SDRF, for providing relief to the victims of natural disasters, so notified in the local context," the affidavit stated.</p>

<p>"It is submitted that information has been received from all the States and UTs in this respect. However, as per information received, it is clarified that no State/UT has provided any ex-gratia to COVID-19 victims from SDRF," the Centre said.</p>

<p>It further said that in accordance with the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission and the experts, the Union of India devised the strategy to deal with, the extremely contagious, volatile and ever changing impact of the mutations of the virus COVID-19, in the best possible manner utilising all the financial, human and infrastructural resources of the nation, rationally and judiciously.</p>

<p>The affidavit states that the central government has already declared Covid as a "disaster" under the Disaster Management Act.</p>

<p>"However, on the issue of 'ex-gratia' assistance on account of loss of life, the guidelines provide that the norms provided by government of India (Ministry of Home Affairs) for assistance from SDRF should be the Minimum Standards of Relief," it said.</p>

<p>Referring to the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission, it said that while considering the disasters of public health such as pandemics, the commission had observed that it feels that financing of preventive and relief measures for such disasters should be left out of the SDRF and NDRF.</p>

<p>The central government said that, currently there is no guideline/policy/ scheme in NDMA which relates to National Insurance mechanism that may be used to pay for disaster related deaths due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>"In this regard it is submitted that the 15th Finance Committee has proposed four Insurance interventions which need to be studied further by the NDMA and relevant ministries for their feasibility," it said.</p>

<p>With regard to simplification of process and redressal mechanism for recording reason of death, the affidavit said that the Registrar General of India will be asked to examine the matter in consultation with all the stakeholders for taking appropriate action in the matter.</p>

<p>While reserving the verdict, it had asked the parties to file written submissions in three days and specifically directed the Centre to simplify the process of grant of death certificates to the dependents of those who have died of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Earlier, on June 11, the Centre had told the top court that issues raised in the pleas, seeking directions for ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4,00,000 to the families of those who have died of COVID-19, are "genuine" and are under consideration of the government.</p>

<p>However later, the government said that paying ex-gratia compensation was beyond the fiscal affordability and the finances of central and state governments as they were under severe strain.</p>

<p>The apex court is hearing two separate pleas filed by lawyers Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to the Centre and the states to provide Rs 4 lakh compensation to the families of coronavirus victims as provisioned under the Act, and a uniform policy for issuing death certificates.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[G A Mir, who is the president of the Congress #39; Jammu and Kashmir unit, was among 14 leaders of eight different parties from the Union Territory who attended the meeting chaired by PM Modi.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">JAMMU: The Centre must follow-up on the positive outcomes of the recent all-party meeting in Delhi for early restoration of democracy in Jammu and Kashmir, Congress leader G A Mir said on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mir, who is the president of the Congress' Jammu and Kashmir unit, was among 14 leaders of eight different parties from the Union Territory who attended the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 24.</p>

<p>Four former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah of the National Conference and Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress were at the meet along with former deputy chief ministers Tara Chand, Nirmal Singh, Kavinder Gupta and Muzzafar Baigh.</p>

<p>Mir said all the political parties responded to the call of the prime minister and this was a positive indication for the way forward.</p>

<p>"Now, it is for the prime minister to respond to this gesture, and the ball is in the court of the Centre to follow-up the positive outcome of the meeting and create a conducive atmosphere for the early restoration of democracy in Jammu and Kashmir," he said.</p>

<p>The 14 politicians also included veteran CPM leader Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami, Peoples' Conference chief Sajad Lone, Panther's Party chief Bhim Singh, BJP leader Ravinder Raina and Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari.</p>

<p>Briefing senior Congress functionaries here on his return from Delhi, Mir said the party's delegation, which was led by Azad, played its role in the right earnest, according to the guidance of the Congress high command.</p>

<p>"Ball is in the court of the Centre now for the positive outcome of the deliberations of the all-party meeting, in which the Congress placed people's priorities rightly, as per the aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir," he said.</p>

<p>Mir said that Azad initiated the deliberations and highlighted the priorities of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to move ahead for restoration of democracy at the earliest.</p>

<p>The issues highlighted by the Congress in the meeting were heard with great patience and attention by Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, the J-K Congress chief said.</p>

<p>Restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's statehood at the earliest before assembly elections, transparent delimitation exercise after taking people on board followed by political process, safeguarding land and job guarantee to the people were among many issues that were raised by the Congress, Mir said.</p>

<p>While welcoming the decision of the Centre for holding an all-party meet, Mir said there appears to be some change in the "mindset and political language of the ruling party (at the Centre) as BJP leaders used foul language against the same leaders in the past who were invited for this meeting".</p>

<p>"It was a step in the right direction for a healthy democracy," Mir said.</p>

<p>However, he regretted that the BJP delegation did not represent the aspirations, sentiments and hardships of the people in the meeting.</p>

<p>One former deputy chief minister, who is from the BJP, only highlighted and listed achievements of the central government, Mir said.</p>

<p>Senior J-K Congress leaders appreciated the role of the party leadership for the series of consultations at all levels to take the entire leadership of J-K on board, a spokesperson said.</p>

<p>"The people as well as the rank and file appreciate the entire exercise undertaken by the Congress leadership and the presentation of facts and issues before the all-party meeting in the right perspective," he said.</p>]]></story>

<title>Tomar appeals to farmers to end stir; Protests held at several places on completion of seven months of agitation</title>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: As their agitation against the new agri laws completed seven months, farmers tried to march to governors' residence in several states on Saturday even as Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar appealed to them to end their stir and offered to resume talks on the provisions of the three legislations.</p>

<p>Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions protesting at various Delhi border points, claimed that farmers were detained in states like Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Telangana during the protests.</p>

<p>Terming Tomar's recent statements as "perplexing and contradictory", it asserted that farmer leaders are not seeking some "meaningless amendments" in the central farm laws which have "fundamental flaws" and urged the people "to punish the BJP".</p>

<p>Security was tightened in the national capital and other cities after the SKM said that representatives of farmers will submit memoranda of their demands, addressed to the President, to governors in various states.</p>

<p>Hundreds of farmers from interiors of Uttar Pradesh, many of them on tractors, reached Ghazipur on Delhi's borders to mark the completion of seven months of the protest.</p>

<p>Led by Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, a group of protesters submitted a memorandum of their demands at the office of DCP Northeast Delhi after a virtual meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal.</p>

<p>The farmers then called off their march to Delhi, BKU media incharge Dharmendra Malik said.</p>

<p>"The memorandum included our demands for the withdrawal of the three new farms laws and for enacting a new law to ensure guarantee for MSP," he told PTI.</p>

<p>Farmers from several parts of Haryana gathered at Gurdwara Nada Sahib in Haryana's Panchkula and headed towards Haryana Raj Bhavan, forcing their way through a layer of barricades, but were stopped at the Chandigarh-Panchkula border where the state police had deployed water cannon and trucks.</p>

<p>"Where was the need to stop the protestors? It was only a matter of handing over a memorandum to the Governor and not allowing even this much is a reflection of the undeclared emergency and authoritarian times we are going through," the SKM said in a statement.</p>

<p>Police used water cannon to stop agitating farmers from Punjab, coming from the Mohali side, but they succeeded in entering Chandigarh after breaking through barricades.</p>

<p>Farmers from several parts of Punjab had assembled at Gurdwara Amb Sahib in Mohali before moving towards the Punjab Governor House.</p>

<p>A majority of the protesters were without masks and were not following COVID-appropriate behaviour.</p>

<p>Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for seven months in protest against the three laws.</p>

<p>The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest.</p>

<p>Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.</p>

<p>"I want to convey through your (media) that farmers should end their agitation. Many are in favour of these new laws across the country. Still, some farmers have any issue with provisions of the laws, Government of India is ready to listen and discuss with them," Agriculture Minister Tomar tweeted.</p>

<p>His earlier offer to resume talks had failed to break the deadlock as the farmers insisted on the scrapping of the laws and sought a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP).</p>

<p>Tomar said the government had held 11 rounds of consultations with protesting farmer unions and has increased the MSP and is procuring more quantity at MSP.</p>

<p>Addressing the protesters at Mohali, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal Rajewal alleged that the central government intended to "hand over farming" to corporate houses.</p>

<p>Carrying flags of unions and raising slogans against the BJP-led government, protesters, including women and youths, marched towards Chandigarh on tractors and other vehicles or walked on foot.</p>

<p>They were stopped near sector 17 by police where some buses were parked on the road to prevent protesters from heading towards Punjab Raj Bhavan.</p>

<p>Rajewal submitted a memorandum to the Chandigarh Deputy Commissioner.</p>

<p>"The memorandum urges the President Shri Ram Nath Kovind to direct the Union Government to immediately accept the legitimate demands of the farmers' movement, repeal the three anti-farmer laws and to enact a law that will guarantee remunerative MSP," the Morcha said in a statement.</p>

<p>Protesters from the Haryana side, led by Haryana BKU (Chaduni) leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Morcha member Yogendra Yadav, gave a memorandum to another official.</p>

<p>Gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, who was booked for his alleged involvement in the violence at the Red Fort on Republic Day during a tractor rally, also participated in the farmers' protests.</p>

<p>A Delhi court on Saturday granted interim protection from arrest to Sidhana.</p>

<p>He had moved Delhi's Tis Hazari court seeking anticipatory bail in the case.</p>

<p>Additional Sessions Judge Neelofer Abida Perveen posted the matter for July 3 and directed the police to not arrest him until then.</p>

<p>Sidhana had earlier denied involvement in the Republic Day violence.</p>

<p>The Morcha said that "Kheti Bachao, Loktantra Bachao Diwas" (save agriculture, save democracy) is being marked all over India on Saturday on the completion of seven months of the farmers' protests and 46 years after the promulgation of Emergency in India in 1975".</p>

<p>The government has maintained it is ready to amend the provisions of the laws.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court had in January put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and has set up a committee to resolve the row.</p>

<p>The committee has submitted its report.</p>

<p>During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders.</p>

<p>The three laws -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by the Parliament in September last year.</p>

<p>Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.</p>

<p>"Farmers are ready to put in their energies to educate fellow citizens and appeal to them to punish BJP. That is the only lesson that the government seems to be willing to listen to", the SKM said after Saturday's protests.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Delhi Police said on Saturday denied reports about the arrest of Tikait and said action will be taken against those spreading such fake news.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: Farmer leaders on Saturday virtually spoke to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal after they claimed they weren't allowed to meet him and submitted to his representative a memorandum addressed to the president demanding repeal of the three farm laws.</p>

<p>Farmers had given a call for a protest march from Civil Lines metro station to the Raj Bhawan, a senior police officer said, adding that the Delhi Police tightened security across borders of the national capital in view of the anticipated march.</p>

<p>The SKM alleged in a statement that protestors were not allowed to meet the LG, and were picked up and taken to the Wazirabad Police Training Centre.</p>

<p>Later on, a brief virtual meeting was arranged with the LG and the memorandum was handed over to his representative, it said.</p>

<p>"The memorandum included our demands for withdrawal of the three farms laws and demand for a new law to ensure guarantee for MSP," BKU media incharge Dharmendra Malik said.</p>

<p>Earlier hundreds of farmers from interiors of Uttar Pradesh reached Ghazipur to mark the completion of seven months of the protest.</p>

<p>Many of them came on tractors.</p>

<p>"Adequate police deployment was made at the site in view of the increased gathering of protestors," a police official said.</p>

<p>A protestor from Moradabad and affiliated to the BKU, said he has been associated with the movement for seven months and intended to continue the stir till the farmers demands were not met.</p>

<p>"Tikait saahab has told us that we have to keep making efforts especially on the 26th of every month in order for the government to listen to our demands," he said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, reports about the arrest of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait were circulating on social media.</p>

<p>The Delhi Police clarified that the reports were fake and said action would be taken against those spreading such news.</p>

<p>"Fake news! News related to arrest of Rakesh Tikait is incorrect. Pl stay away from such fake news/tweets. Action will be taken for spreading such false news/tweets," Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) tweeted.</p>

<p>BKU media in-charge Malik also said that Tikait had not been arrested.</p>

<p>"Tikait was not arrested by the police. He's still at the Ghazipur protest site where demonstration is underway against the farm laws. There is no conflict situation at the protest site," Malik said.</p>

<p>The Delhi Metro decided to shut down three main stations on the Yellow Line for four hours on Saturday.</p>

<p>"As advised by the Delhi Police, in view of security reasons, three metro stations of Yellow Line namely, Vishwavidyalaya, Civil Lines and Vidhan Sabha, will remain closed for public from 10 am to 2 pm tomorrow i.e, 26.06.2021 (Saturday)," the DMRC had tweeted on Friday night.</p>

<p>Saturday marks the completion of seven months of protests by the farmers.</p>

<p>They began their stir by camping at Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana, besides at Tikri and Ghazipur borders.</p>

<p>The protesting farmers have demanded the withdrawal of the Centre's farm laws and that a new law be made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.</p>

<description><![CDATA[Ravinder Raina, his senior party colleagues and former deputy chief ministers, Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta, attended the June 24 all-party meeting on J amp;K chaired by PM Narendra Modi.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>JAMMU: Some leaders are still dreaming about the restoration of Article 370 which is "next to impossible", Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina said Saturday, advising political parties to leave the chapter behind and take part in assembly polls whenever they are held.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at his party headquarters here upon his return from Delhi where he took party in an all-party, he also said the Centre is promise-bound to restore the statehood to Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

<p>"Some leaders are still dreaming about the restoration of Article 370 which gave birth to separatism, terrorism and Pakistani ideology in J&K and claimed lakhs of lives and caused pain to the people. Its restoration is next to impossible. It cannot be restored till doomsday," Raina told.</p>

<p>Raina, his senior party colleagues and former deputy chief ministers, Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta, attended the June 24 all-party meeting on J&K chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>

<p>Flanked by Gupta and other party leaders, the J&K BJP president said here Saturday the meeting ended nearly two-and-a-half-year long political deadlock in the union territory.</p>

<p>Asked about PDP president Mehbooba Mufti's remarks that she will not take part in elections till the restoration of Article 370, Raina said registered political parties should now move on and work for the welfare of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

<p>"They should take part in the elections whenever held. It is their democratic righteveryone should take part in the elections even if held early," he said, and added that during the meeting in the national capital leaders discussed all issues in a cordial atmosphere including the restoration of statehood.</p>

<p>"Home Minister Amit Shah made it clear to the participants that he had assured on the floor of the house that the statehood will be restored when the situation gets normal.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister had also, in his address to the nation, had talked about the restoration of statehood," he said.</p>

<p>He said some leaders, toeing their respective party line, are also talking about Ladakh, but they need to understand the region is a separate Union Territory.</p>

<p>"Ladakh was carved out of J&K and made a separate Union Territory on August 5, 2019. That is the truth."</p>

<p>Asked about the statement of senior Congress leader P Chidambaram that the Centre wants to hold assembly elections before restoring the statehood to J&K, Raina said, "He was not in the meeting but there are some leaders in the Congress who are making anti-national statements."</p>

<p>They should stop making anti-national statements.</p>

<p>He said all the 14 participants put forth their viewpoint in the meeting and "we also raised all issues concerning Jammu and Kashmir".</p>

<p>"We became the strong voice of the nationalist people of Jammu and Kashmir and talking on all issues -- from delimitation to a dignified return of Kashmiri Pandits," he said, adding, "we asked the Centre to set up an apex committee to prepare a roadmap for their return".</p>

<p>Raina said the BJP delegation highlighted the issues of different sections of the society including the refugees from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and demanded de-freezing of some of the seats reserved for PoK areas in the J&K Assembly which "we are separately raising with delimitation commission shortly".</p>

<p>He said the prime minister's assertion that he wanted to end 'Dilli ki duri' as well as 'Dil ki duri' (distance from Delhi and distance of hearts) during the June 24 meeting makes it clear that the doors of New Delhi are open for the people of J&K.</p>

<p>"The prime minister's call was to come together in the interest of the nation to fulfil the dream of 'New J&K and Strong J&K'. The government will ensure adequate funds for all-round development of J&K," Raina said.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p>PANAJI: Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday said testing has been ramped up at the borders of the coastal state as a precaution in view of the detection of the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus in a neighbouring state.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters at the Keri-Sattari border adjoining Karnataka, Sawant said private laboratories have been roped in to set up testing facilities as a precaution against the fresh strain of coronavirus.</p>

<title>Maharashtra BJP holds statewide protest to demand OBC quota in local bodies</title>
<author>PTI</author>
<source>PTI</source>
<pubDate>Saturday, June 26, 2021 05:50 PM +0530</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[Addressing BJP workers in Nagpur, Devendra Fadnavis said his party will restore reservation for OBCs in local bodies if given power, and if not, he will retire from politics.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>MUMBAI: The Maharashtra unit of the BJP on Saturday held 'chakka jam' or road blockade protests across the state demanding restoration of reservation for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) in local governing bodies which was quashed by the Supreme Court in March this year.</p>

<p>The party had announced that it would hold agitation at 1,000 locations across the state.</p>

<p>Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis participated in a protest in his home district Nagpur, while Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar took part in an agitation in Thane, due to which traffic on the road connecting the city with Mumbai affected for some time.</p>

<p>Addressing BJP workers in Nagpur, Fadnavis said his party will restore reservation for OBCs in local bodies if given power, and if not, he will retire from politics.</p>

<p>"The fact is that this issue can be resolved at the state level. The state government can restore the reservation by formulating a law. There is no need for any act of the Central government. That is why OBC reservation is prevalent in other states except in Maharashtra. You (MVA) will have to make a law. We will not stop until we expose their lie. This protest is held to condemn this government on the issue," he said.</p>

<p>Fadnavis, who represents Nagpur South-West seat in the Assembly, said OBCs are being purposely deprived of the political reservation.</p>

<p>"I want to appeal to all the OBC ministers in the MVA government. There is no enmity between us and them. If you are honest towards the cause of the OBCs then regardless of party lines we are ready to stand with you. I want to tell you with full confidence that within the next three to four months we can bring back the OBC reservation. If you give us power.....I want to tell you with confidence that if I fail to bring back the political reservation for OBCs, I will retire from politics," the former chief minister said.</p>

<p>Former minister Pankaja Munde, who led a protest in Pune, said if the BJP's demand are not met, the party will launch bigger protests in future.</p>

<p>The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state has failed to retain political reservation for the OBCs, which is necessary for the community's uplift, she said.</p>

<p>Munde alleged the state government kept deferring various elections, including those in the cooperative sector, when the case regarding the OBC reservation was pending in the court, and it was only after the court scrapped the quota, the elections were announced.</p>

<p>"We are demanding that the OBC reservation be restored and till then no elections should be held. We want the government to approach the Election Commission along with us with a demand to postpone elections," she said.</p>

<p>"If the elections are held without the OBC reservation, then we will resort to bigger protests. This 'chakka jam' protest is just a trailer," she added.</p>

<p>Munde alleged the state government was trying to muzzle the voice of OBCs by depriving them of quota in local bodies.</p>

<p>"The Supreme Court's decision should not be viewed as a defeat. We will continue our battle for the quota and try to get it back by mounting pressure on the state government," she said.</p>

<p>Former minister and BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said the BJP has decided to intensify the agitation in the coming days.</p>

<p>"We will not retreat even if more than 1,000 party workers are arrested by the state police," he said.</p>

<p>Another BJP leader and former state minister Girish Mahajan and MLA Mangal Prabhat Lodha held a protest outside Mantralaya, the state secretariat in Mumbai, over the issue.</p>

<p>The BJP-Shiv Sena government in 2019 had allotted political reservation to OBCs in local governing bodies, but in March this year, the Supreme Court had read it down.</p>

<p>The BJP has alleged that the case was lost only because of the inaction of the Shiv Sena-led MVA government, in which NCP and Congress are partners.</p>

<p>The State Election Commission had announced bypolls at Dhule, Nandurbar, Washim, Akola and Nagpur districts, and there are 85 seats of Zilla Parishad and 144 panchayat samiti seats for which elections is going to be held.</p>

<p>The BJP on Friday demanded that the state government approach the Supreme Court immediately requesting that the ZP bypolls be deferred in five districts.</p>

<p>Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil challenged OBC leaders in the state government for a public debate with Fadnavis on the issue "so that truth will come out".</p>

<p>"Senior leaders and ministers like Chhagan Bhujbal who have been the face of the OBC community for some years should debate why the OBC quota was read down by the Supreme Court in March this year. He should join a debate with Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis at a public function so that everyone will come to know what the truth is," Patil told reporters in Kolhapur.</p>

<p>Patil said state OBC welfare minister Vijay Wadettiwar or state Congress chief Nana Patole can join the debate, if it is not possible for Bhujbal to participate.</p>

<p>"People will come to know who made the mistake," he added.</p>

<p>"This MVA government did nothing during the last 15 hearings before the Supreme Court (on OBC quota issue). It did not submit the empirical data hence the court verdict went against the OBC reservation. The state can still set up a backward commission and prepare empirical data," he said.</p>

<p>Patil said this government had taken several decisions that went against various communities and groups.</p>

<p>"The government has lost cases for OBC and Maratha quotas in the Supreme Court. This government also cancelled the reservation quota in promotion in the state administration," he added.</p>]]></story>

<title>Over 870 cell phones involved in cybercrimes seized from Fraud-To-Phone gang</title>

<description><![CDATA[The action against the cyber crime network has been initiated by the Union Home Ministry #39;s cyber safety wing FCORD.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: Over 870 new mobile phones worth Rs 86 lakh were seized from a gang of Fraud-To-Phone (F2P) involved in cybercrimes in joint efforts by police forces of four states.</p>

<p>The action against the cyber crime network has been initiated by the Union Home Ministry's cyber safety wing FCORD.</p>

<p>"Continued efforts lead to the neutralisation of another significant subsidiary node of the F2P network," an official said.</p>

<p>In a follow-up of leads generated by CyberSafe, an app created by FCORD, and investigations by Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh and Haryana Police, 872 new mobile phones of different companies worth Rs 86 lakh were seized and Rs 15.15 lakh cash recovered from three arrested accused, the official said.</p>

<p>Till date, more than 1,100 cell phones worth Rs 1.5 crore and nearly Rs 25 lakh cash have been seized from the F2P Network and at least 25 accused arrested.</p>

<p>The key nodes in the Haryana network were active members of the Balaghat WhatsApp groups run by the prime accused of the F2P network, Hukum Singh Bisen.</p>

<p>Another accused, Rajat Madan of Kaithal, was found in possession of the 872 mobile phones and he was subsequently arrested along with his associate, Sudhir Narang, also an accused.</p>

<p>This sub-network had a much more varied mix of mobile phones in stock, displaying no particular preference for specific Chinese brands, another official said.</p>

<p>The transaction trail for the purchase of almost all of the 872 mobile phones was through UPI, implying the rising importance of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) in assisting Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) in preventing cyber-frauds, the official said.</p>

<p>With more enforcement agencies using CyberSafe, the gap between LEAs and fintech entities is being bridged for all-round benefit of the unsuspecting victim of cyber-fraud, the official said.</p>

<p>CyberSafe is an app created by FCORD, operative from August 2019.</p>

<p>It links more than 3,000 LEAs, including police stations, in 19 States and UTs with 18 fintech entities online and in real-time.</p>

<p>Fraudster's mobile numbers are the key to CyberSafe.</p>

<p>As soon as a victim informs the police, the information is entered on CyberSafe and in realtime, fund flows are identified and communicated.</p>

<p>Till now 65,000 phone frauds were reported on this app and 55,000 phone numbers and several thousand bank accounts of fraudsters identified.</p>

<p>Soon, the NPCI will be integrating with CyberSafe, expanding the ambit of realtime prevention of cyber crime to the UPI domain, thereby amplifying its success in crime prevention, manifold.</p>

<p>CyberSafe runs a website https://cybersafe.gov.in, which provides access only to law enforcement authorities and fintech entities.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: As farmers' protest against the new farm laws entered eighth month, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday appealed to protesting farmers to end their agitation while saying that the government is ready to resume talks on the provisions of three legislations.</p>

<p>The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest.</p>

<p>Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.</p>

<p>Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for seven months now in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and has set up a committee to find solutions.</p>

<p>The committee has submitted its report.</p>

<p>"I want to convey through your (media) that farmers should end their agitation....Many are in favour of these new laws across the country. Still, some farmers have any issue with provisions of the laws, Government of India is ready to listen and discuss with them," Tomar tweeted.</p>

<p>He said the government held 11 rounds of consultations with protesting farmer unions.</p>

<p>The government has increased the minimum support price (MSP) and is procuring more quantity at MSP.</p>

<p>Farmers' protest had started on November 26 last year and has now completed seven months notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Three union ministers, including Tomar and Food Minister Piyush Goyal, have held 11 rounds of talks with the protesting farmer unions.</p>

<p>In the last meeting on January 22, the government's negotiations with 41 farmer groups hit a roadblock as the unions squarely rejected the Centre's proposal of putting the laws on suspension.</p>

<p>During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders.</p>

<p>The three laws -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by the Parliament in September last year.</p>

<p>Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.</p>

<p>On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.</p>

<p>Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee.</p>

<p>Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) President Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati are the other members on the panel.</p>

<p>They have completed the consultation process with stakeholders and submitted the report.</p>

<description><![CDATA[Vaccination for those over 60 years of age and those of 45-plus with co-morbidities started from March 1 at both government and private centres.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: The pace of vaccination of the 60-plus population has become sluggish in the past few weeks after an initial high, with healthcare experts attributing it to mobility issues and misinformation and unsubstantiated apprehensions about the jabs.</p>

<p>According to Health Ministry data, 2.29 crore elderly people have been fully vaccinated so far while 6.71 crore have received just one dose of COVID-19 vaccine till now.</p>

<p>The 60-plus population in India was projected to be at 14.3 crore in 2021, so that would imply that just 16 per cent of them have been fully vaccinated till now.</p>

<p>Vaccination for those over 60 years of age and those of 45-plus with co-morbidities started from March 1 at both government and private centres.</p>

<p>On an average about 80.77 lakh vaccine doses were given to the 60-plus population per week between March 13 and April 2, but the weekly figure dropped to about 32 lakh between June 5 to 25, according to the data.</p>

<p>Healthcare experts expressed concern over the slow place of vaccination of the 60-plus people who are more prone to have co-morbidities and remain more susceptible to severe disease.</p>

<p>Dr Sujeet Ranjan, Executive Director of The Coalition for Food and Nutrition Security (CFNS), said myths, misconceptions and rumours about COVID-19 vaccines are the biggest hurdle to vaccination coverage.</p>

<p>"Some people think they will never contract COVID-19, others believe that the virus itself is on the way out. Irrational mistrust of scientifically approved vaccines is also a factor. While vaccine hesitancy has always been a phenomenon in our country, today it tends to accentuated by opinions on social media, where even people with no subject expertise but having wide following can influence people," he said.</p>

<p>"Some people in rural areas believe that COVID-19 is mostly for urban people. Also, many people have heard on the social media that the vaccine and its side-effects will show up two to three years from now. These rumours, suspicion and fear are making it harder to remove vaccine hesitancy," he added.</p>

<p>He said it has also been observed that most public places in rural areas lack senior citizen-friendly infrastructure.</p>

<p>Hospitals have expressed concern over the slow pace of vaccination of 60-plus people who also suffer from the maximum number of comorbidities.</p>

<p>Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said vaccine hesitancy in the elderly population is a very real issue.</p>

<p>"Among many factors, one is a fear that people with previous heart disease will have some issue because of some unfortunate videos that were circulating around. Some people have done their CRP (c-reactive protein) tests also to see if that was raised and then they feel that they should not take the vaccine," Bajaj said.</p>

<p>Bajaj said mobility is also a very big issue for the 60-plus age group.</p>

<p>"The most important problem is mobility because they are not really able to visit the vaccination centres themselves and also they have a fear that if they go into a crowded place, they will catch Covid. We need to ensure that we educate them about the various risk factors and try to provide vaccination to them at their doorstep," he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Piyush Goel, Senior Consultant- Pulmonary and Critical Care, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, Gurugram, said for mass-scale vaccine coverage, vaccine hesitancy is one of the biggest hurdles.</p>

<p>"As there has been a recent drop in the pace of vaccination among people above the age of 60, there are fears that this vaccine hesitancy can hamper the coverage of this population group most vulnerable to COVID-19," he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Roshan Palresha, Consultant - Emergency Medicine, Columbia Asia Hospital, Pune, said the recent drop in Covid vaccine coverage among the 60-plus group of people is a cause of concern as they are more prone to have comorbidities, and remain more susceptible to severe disease.</p>

<p>People aged 60 and more must understand that while the number of infected people may go up or down, their vulnerability to the disease and chances of mortality remain the same, and can be reduced only with vaccines," he said.</p>

<p>"In the past we have successfully reduced cases of HIV/AIDS and polio through sustained and focussed media campaigns, and it should help this time too.</p>

<p>Government representatives must engage in dialogue with these people and may also come up with non-financial incentives to encourage people," he suggested.</p>

<p>Dr. HK Mahajan, Anesthesiologist, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Vasant Kunj, said focus should be on getting across two key vaccine messages -- vaccines provide protection against COVID-19 and vaccines are safe.</p>

<p>Mahajan said vaccine hesitancy in people over the age of 60 years in India could also be because of misinformation, myth and skepticism.</p>

<p>To counter this, Mahajan suggested that front-line health workers and hospitals should issue statements in favour of vaccination.</p>

<p>"Influential people like film actors, famous personalities should also be tapped to appeal to the public to get vaccinated," he said.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[The govt approached the Supreme Court challenging the order of a Single Judge of the Kerala High Court dismissing the petition to end the case.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>KOCHI: The Kerala government has filed a Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Supreme Court seeking to withdraw the criminal case against Education Minister V Sivankutty, former higher education minister KT Jaleel, and four LDF leaders.</p>

<p>The case pertains to the ruckus that took place in Kerala Assembly during the budget session in 2015 when opposition LDF MLAs broke chairs, snapped mikes, and climbed atop tables protesting against then finance minister KM Mani. Former MLAs EP Jayarajan, K Ajith, C K Sadasivan, and K Kunjammed are the other accused persons in the case.</p>

<p>The government approached the Supreme Court challenging the order of a Single Judge of the Kerala High Court dismissing the petition to end the case. As per the prosecution case, the accused persons, who were opposition MLAs at that time, disrupted the budget presentation and climbed on to the Speaker's dais, damaged articles like the Speaker's chair, computer, mike, and emergency lamp to stop late KM Mani from presenting the budget. The ruckus caused a loss of Rs 2,20,093 to the state exchequer.</p>

<p><strong>ALSO READ | <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2021/jun/25/putting-an-endto-dowry-menacein-kerala-society-2321179.html" target="_blank">Putting an end to dowry menace in Kerala society</a></strong></p>

<p>In the SLP, the state government argued that the accused persons are entitled to the protection of legislative privileges of their acts committed on the floor of the house. The state also contended that the Single Judge had failed to appreciate that the incident happened on the floor of the Legislative Assembly during the budget session as a part of the protest by opposition members of the legislative assembly against the budget presentation. </p>

<p>In such circumstances, it was not proper to dismiss an application filed by the prosecutor on the ground that the application submitted by the public prosecutor was not in good faith and not supported by any cogent reason. Besides no crime could have been registered without the previous sanction of the Speaker.</p>

<p>The accused persons being in relation to their function to protest as members of the legislative assembly, the MLA's who are accused in this FIR, are entitled to get protection under the Constitution. As the protest of the MLAs was in relation to their function as members of the Legislative Assembly, no criminal proceedings can be initiated, the state argued.</p>]]></story>

<title>Will retire from politics if BJP fails to bring back political reservation for OBCs: Devendra Fadnavis</title>

<description><![CDATA[Former-Maharashtra CM and BJP leader  Devendra Fadnavis, who represents Nagpur South-West seat in the Assembly, said OBCs are being purposely deprived of the political reservation.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>NAGPUR: Senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said his party will restore reservation for OBCs in local bodies if given power, and if not, he will retire from politics.</p>

<p>Addressing BJP workers during a protest held at Variety Square chowk as part of the party's 'chakka jam' (block the traffic) agitation for the restoration of OBC quota, the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly alleged the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was misleading the people by saying that it will raise this issue in Parliament.</p>

<p>"The fact is that this issue can be resolved at the state level. The state government can restore the reservation by formulating a law. There is no need for any act of the Central government. That is why OBC reservation is prevalent in other states except in Maharashtra. You (MVA) will have to make a law. We will not stop until we expose their lie. This protest is held to condemn this government on the issue," he said.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court had in its March 4 order said that reservation in favour of OBCs in concerned local bodies in Maharashtra cannot exceed aggregate 50 per cent of the total seats reserved for Scheduled Castes, the Scheduled Tribes and OBCs took together.</p>

<p>The apex court, while reading down section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act 1961, which provided 27 per cent reservation for persons belonging to the backward class, also quashed the notifications issued by the state election commission in 2018 and 2020 providing reservation exceeding 50 per cent in local bodies of some districts.</p>

<p>Fadnavis, who represents Nagpur South-West seat in the Assembly, said OBCs are being purposely deprived of the political reservation.</p>

<p>"I want to appeal to all the OBC ministers in the MVA government. There is no enmity between us and them. If you are honest towards the cause of the OBCs then regardless of party lines we are ready to stand with you. I want to tell you with full confidence that within the next three to four months we can bring back the OBC reservation. If you give us power....I want to tell you with confidence that if I fail to bring back the political reservation for OBCs, I will retire from politics," the former chief minister said.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the Maharashtra unit of the BJP held 'chakka jam' protest across the state.</p>

<p>The party had earlier announced that it would hold agitation at 1,000 locations across the state.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p>BHOPAL: At least eight persons have been found infected with the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus in Madhya Pradesh so far, state Medical Education Minister Vishwas Sarang said on Saturday, adding none of the contacts of these patients was found to be infected with this strain.</p>

<p>According to officials, two persons who died in May this year were found to be infected with the Delta Plus variant.</p>

<p>"At least eight cases of the Delta Plus variant of coronavirus have been brought to our notice so far. Our constant focus is to ramp up testing," Sarang said.</p>

<p>The authorities had carried out contact tracing of these patients and none of the contacts was found to be infected with this variant, he said.</p>

<p>The minister further said Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has decided to set up a laboratory in Bhopal for genome sequencing so that people infected with different mutations of coronavirus can be detected at the earliest.</p>

<p>Once a genome sequencing machine is installed in Bhopal, the test reports for various mutations of coronavirus can be received within five days, he said.</p>

<p>A couple of days earlier, it was found during a random genome sequencing test that he had been infected with the Delta Plus variant, he said.</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday, Ujjain Collector Ashish Singh had confirmed that a 59-year-old woman, who died of COVID-19 on May 23, was infected with the Delta Plus variant.</p>

<p>She had tested positive for coronavirus on May 17.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p>KOLKATA: Actor-turned-TMC MP Mimi Chakraborty on Saturday fell ill, a few days after she was administered a fake COVID vaccine, sources said.</p>

<p>However, the doctor who attended to the Jadavpur MP said it was too early to link her illness with the fake jab that she had taken four days ago, they said.</p>

<p>Chakraborty became seriously ill at her residence in the morning and her maid called the family physician, sources close to the renowned actor said.</p>

<p>The actor, who has been suffering from gall bladder and liver-related problems, suffered from dehydration, stomach ache and her blood pressure count dipped, they said.</p>

<p>"Mimi Chakraborty's condition is now stable and she is under treatment at her home. She is also suffering from hypertension. The doctor who attended to her said her illness cannot be immediately linked to the fake vaccine as she already had a liver problem," the sources said.</p>

<p>Chakraborty, whose alertness led to the busting of a fake vaccine racket organised by a conman posing as a civic official in Kolkata, was scheduled to undergo a test during the day to ascertain any possible adverse effects of the jab.</p>

<p>In a video message on Thursday, she had asked people not to panic.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed the development plan for Ayodhya and asserted that the temple town in Uttar Pradesh should manifest the "the finest of our traditions and the best of our developmental transformations".</p>

<p>Speaking at a virtual meeting, which was also attended by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Modi described Ayodhya as a city that is etched in the cultural consciousness of every Indian and said the human ethos of this city must be matched by futuristic infrastructure.</p>

<p>A Prime Minister's Office (PMO) statement on the meeting said Ayodhya's development is being envisaged as a spiritual centre, global tourism hub and a sustainable smart city.</p>

<p>At the meeting, Uttar Pradesh government officials made a presentation which encompassed various aspects of Ayodhya's development.</p>

<p>The prime minister was informed about various upcoming and proposed infrastructure projects to improve connectivity with Ayodhya and various projects like airport, expansion of railway station, bus station, roads and highways were discussed, the PMO said.</p>

<p>An upcoming greenfield township was discussed which includes lodging facilities for devotees, space for ashrams, maths, hotels, bhavans of various states.</p>

<p>A tourist facilitation centre and a world class museum will also be built, it said.</p>

<p>"Ayodhya should manifest the finest of our traditions and the best of our developmental transformations," the prime minister was quoted as saying at the meeting by the statement.</p>

<p>Noting that Ayodhya is both spiritual and sublime, he said the human ethos of this city must be matched by futuristic infrastructure, which is beneficial for everyone including tourists and pilgrims.</p>

<p>Modi said that the coming generations should feel the desire to visit Ayodhya at least once in their lifetime.</p>

<p>The prime minister pointed out that developmental works in Ayodhya will continue in the foreseeable future and stressed that at the same time, the momentum towards heralding Ayodhya to this next leap of progress must begin now.</p>

<p>"It is our collective endeavour to celebrate the identity of Ayodhya and keep its cultural vibrancy alive through innovative ways," Modi said.</p>

<p>The way Lord Ram had the ability to bring people together, the development works of Ayodhya should be guided by a spirit of healthy public participation, especially by the youth, Modi said.</p>

<p>He called for the skills of talented youngsters to be leveraged in this development of the city, according to the PMO.</p>

<p>The PMO also said special attention is being devoted to development of infrastructure around the Saryu river and its ghats.</p>

<p>Cruise operations on the Saryu river will also be made a regular feature, it said.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p>JAMMU: The biggest grain market in Jammu wore a deserted look on Saturday as the local traders' body decided to continue the weekend lockdown amid the detection of the first case of COVID-19 Delta Plus variant in the province.</p>

<p>The Jammu and Kashmir administration on June 20 announced the lifting of the weekend curfew from eight districts, including Jammu, owing to a significant improvement in Covid-19 situation.</p>

<p>All shops and business establishments in the Nehru Market and adjoining areas including Asia Chowk and Vikram chowk remained closed in response to the call given by Traders Federation Ware House Nehru Market.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: To mark the completion of seven months of the ongoing farmers' agitation, the farmers will take out a tractor rally on Saturday in the national capital and will submit memorandums to Governors across the country against the three farm laws.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While speaking to ANI, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) youth wing president Gaurav Tikait at Ghazipur (Delhi-Uttar Pradesh) border said, "We'll submit memorandums to Governors (for repeal of new farm laws) across the country today. The movement will remain peaceful."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Farmers camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders will observe today as the "Save Agriculture, Save Democracy Day" to mark the completion of seven months of their agitation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said it will send a memorandum from all over India to the President on June 26, on farmers' "anguish and indignation" and appeal to him regarding getting the farmer laws repealed, and to get a legal guarantee of minimum support price for farmers.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, police and paramilitary forces have been deployed to maintain the law and order situation in the national capital in view of farmers' tractor rally. According to official sources, intelligence agencies have alerted Delhi police and other agencies that Pakistan-based ISI proxies may sabotage the proposed farmers' protest.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A letter has been sent to Delhi Police and other agencies concerned. After receiving the letter, adequate arrangements have been made by the Delhi Police. "Adequate security arrangements have been made and some metro stations will also remain shut for a few hours on Saturday," sources said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a precautionary measure and to avoid any turbulence in the law and order situation, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided to keep three Metro stations -- Vishwavidyalaya, Civil Lines and Vidhan Sabha shut from 10 am to 2 pm on Saturday. The step has been taken on the advice of Delhi police, which has also made elaborate security arrangements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several farmer groups are also expected to join the protesting farmers at Delhi's border points today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Farmers have been protesting on the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws - Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.</p>]]></story>

<title>After ED summons, ex-Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh seeks fresh date for appearance</title>
<author>PTI</author>
<source>PTI</source>
<pubDate>Saturday, June 26, 2021 01:02 PM +0530</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[The central agency had Friday night arrested his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde after it carried out raids against them and Deshmukh in Mumbai and Nagpur.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh has sought a fresh date for appearance before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) which had summoned him for questioning on Saturday in a money laundering case related to an alleged multi-crore bribery-cum-extortion racket that led to his resignation in April, officials said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The 71-year-old Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader was asked to depose before the investigating officer at the agency office in Ballard Estate here by 11 am, they said. A team of Deshmukh's lawyers visited the ED office and sought a fresh date for appearance, officials said, adding that the agency is expected to accept his request.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The central agency had arrested his personal secretary Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde late last night after it carried out raids against them and Deshmukh in Mumbai and Nagpur. The aides were brought to the ED office for questioning following the searches and arrested subsequently.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They will be produced before a special court for cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in Mumbai on Saturday where the ED will seek their remand for custodial interrogation, officials said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI first carried out a preliminary inquiry followed by a regular case being filed on the orders of the Bombay High Court. The court had asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the allegations of bribery made against Deshmukh by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deshmukh, who had resigned from his post in April following the allegations, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The senior IPS officer was shunted out from his post after investigators revealed the role of assistant police inspector Sachin Waze in the stationing of an explosive-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's Mumbai residence that triggered a terror scare. Waze has since been dismissed from service.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In his letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the police commissioner's post, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh had asked Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the ED, about 10 bar owners in Mumbai recorded statements before it alleging that they had paid about Rs 4 crore "bribe" in cash in a three-month period to be handed over to Deshmukh through police officials.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Deshmukh was the home minister in the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra headed by Thackeray. In his letter, Singh also alleged that Palande was present when Deshmukh had asked Waze to extort money.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Palande and Shinde had been questioned by the CBI in the past. The role of the two in the operation of certain shell firms is being looked into by the ED.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The CBI booked Deshmukh and others under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections related to criminal conspiracy and the section of the Prevention of Corruption Act for "attempt to obtain undue advantage for improper and dishonest performance of public duty".</p>]]></story>

<title>2015 Kotkapura police firing case: SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal appears before SIT</title>

<description><![CDATA[In the Kotkapura police firing incident, police opened fire at people protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib in Faridkot in 2015.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">CHANDIGARH: SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal on Saturday appeared before a special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 Kotkapura police firing incident. Badal reached the Punjab Police Officers Institute at Sector 32 here at around 11 am following a summons by the SIT.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Badal was the deputy chief minister and holding the home portfolio when incidents of desecration of religious texts and the subsequent police firing at people protesting against it had taken place in Faridkot in 2015.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders, including Bikram Singh Majithia, Balwinder Singh Bhundar, NK Sharma and Daljit Singh Cheema, reached the Punjab Police Officers Institute in a show of support to Badal.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On Tuesday, the SIT led by Additional Director General of Police (Vigilance Bureau) L K Yadav had questioned Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal for two-and-a-half hours.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Punjab government had formed the new SIT to probe the Kotkapura police firing incident following the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The new SIT is investigating the two FIRs registered on October 14, 2015 and August 7, 2018 in connection with the Kotkapura incident.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The high court had on April 9 this year quashed a report by an earlier Punjab Police SIT into the firing at people protesting in Kotkapura in 2015 over the alleged desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Faridkot district.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Police had also opened fire at a similar demonstration in Behbal Kalan, also in Faridkot, where two people were killed. A separate probe is underway in that case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu hit out at Sukhbir and said that "today new SIT inches closer to justice for Punjab's soul and you are crying of political interference". "6 Yrs since sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib Ji.. No Justice in 2 yrs of your rule. No Justice in the following 4.5 yrs.. Today, New SIT inches closer to Justice for Punjab's Soul & you cry of political interference.. Political interference was that which delayed Justice by 6 yrs," Sidhu said in a tweet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The SAD president on Friday alleged that a new SIT formed after the old one was indicted over political interference and it is being run by the state vigilance department, so nothing has changed. "While farmers suffer, CM is busy keeping Gandhi family happy & has accepted @RahulGandhi's directive to implicate SAD leadership in false cases. New SIT formed after old one was indicted over political interference, is being run by state vigilance dept, so nothing has changed," he tweeted.</p>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: India has achieved the milestone of conducting 40 crore COVID-19 tests, with the average of more than 18 lakh tests per day in the month of June, the ICMR said on Saturday. India has tested 40,18,11,892 samples across the country till Friday, it said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The country tested 35 crore COVID-19 samples till June 1, 2021. "This has been enabled by rapidly increasing testing infrastructure and capacity across the country. ICMR has been enhancing COVID-19 testing capability across the country by expanding and diversifying testing capacity by leveraging technology and facilitating innovation in affordable diagnostic kits," the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in a statement.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Prof Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR said exponential increase in testing has led to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of COVID-19 cases. These have eventually resulted in a sustained low fatality rate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"This testing milestone is testimony to the fact that India has been successful in implementing the strategy of 5T approach 'Test, Track, Trace, Treat and use of Technology' efficiently, which will enable us to contain the spread of the pandemic," the statement quoted Bhargava as saying.</p>]]></story>

<title>Opposition alliance at national level incomplete without Congress: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut</title>
<author>PTI</author>

<description><![CDATA[Raut #39;s statements come four days after leaders of eight opposition parties  assembled at NCP chief Sharad Pawar #39;s residence in New Delhi and discussed various issues facing the country.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Saturday said that work is on to bring all opposition parties together at the national level, and this alliance will be incomplete without the Congress. He said that the Congress will play an important role in the alliance that aims to provide a strong alternative to the present dispensation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Raut's statements come four days after leaders of eight opposition parties, including Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, AAP, RLD and the Left, assembled at NCP chief Sharad Pawar's residence in New Delhi and discussed various issues facing the country.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Speculation has been rife that the agenda of the meeting, for which no Congress leader was present, was to discuss a possible alliance which could be an alternative to the BJP.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Talking to reporters here, Raut said, "There is no need of the third front or any other front. Sharad Pawar has already made it clear. Similarly, Shiv Sena through (party mouthpiece) 'Saamana' has voiced similar sentiments. And I have also read that the Congress has endorsed this view."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The Congress will play an important role in the alliance. It will be a strong alternative to the present dispensation...Work is in progress to bring all the opposition parties together, which will not be complete till the Congress is roped in," he said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharad Pawar on Friday claimed that formation of any national alliance was not the topic of discussion at the meeting of eight opposition parties hosted by him, but also said that if any such coalition emerges, its leadership will have to be "collective".</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A day after that meeting, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole had said that any attempt to form an 'anti-BJP front' without his party will indirectly help the BJP. On Friday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted raids at former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh's premises in Mumbai and Nagpur as part of a money-laundering probe against him.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It also arrested Deshmukh's two aides in this connection. Without naming the BJP, Raut said, "The ED action against Anil Deshmukh amounts to targeting political rivals out of frustration since they were unable to form the government in the state. Sharad Pawar has also said the same thing."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The state investigation agencies can also probe important cases, but attempts are on to target NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress. We will also see," Sena's Rajya Sabha member said.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p>RAIPUR: The monsoon session of the Chhattisgarh Assembly will begin from July 26, a notification issued by the Vidhan Sabha secretariat said.</p>

<p>The session will have five working days.</p>

<p>The upcoming session is likely to be stormy as the opposition parties—BJP and Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (J), have geared-up to target the ruling Congress government on issues of Covid-19 vaccination, loss of paddy during rains owing to lack of proper storage, liquor prohibition, alleged deteriorating law and order situation, issues of tribals in Bastar, elephant menace among others.</p>

<p>All the specified Covid protocols are to be strictly complied during the session and public is not likely to be allowed to watch the proceedings from the visitors' gallery. The glass panels have already been installed to separate the seating spaces of the legislators.<br />

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday arrested former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh's personal assistant Kundan Shinde and personal secretary Sanjeev Palande in connection with an alleged money laundering case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This comes a day after the ED raided Deshmukh's residences in Nagpur and Mumbai. According to the ED, the raids were conducted at five places.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking to the media after the raids, Deshmukh on Friday said that former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh had made false allegations against him after he was removed from the post over his suspicious role.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Why did not he level allegations when he was still holding the post? You know Param Bir Singh made false allegations against me after he was removed from the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner because his role was very suspicious," Deshmukh said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The ED on May 11 had registered a case of money laundering against Deshmukh. Earlier in April, the CBI had conducted raids at four premises of Deshmukh after registering an FIR against him in connection with the case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">An FIR was filed based on Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect of an official act) and criminal conspiracy (IPC 120 B).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sources confirmed that during the searches, the CBI recovered incriminating documents and digital devices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Param Bir Singh, in his letter to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, had alleged that Deshmukh had indulged in "malpractices" and asked suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crores every month.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Waze was arrested in March in connection with the National Investigation Agency's (NIA) probe into the case of recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai and the subsequent murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[Kaskar #39;s alleged involvement in the case surfaced following the recent seizure of 27 kg of hashish.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">THANE/ MUMBAI: A court at Bhiwandi in Maharashtra's Thane district has remanded Iqbal Kaskar, brother of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, in the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) custody for one day in a drugs case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Magistrate MM Mali on Friday remanded Kaskar in the anti-drugs agency's custody. Kaskar's alleged involvement in the case surfaced following the recent seizure of 27 kg of hashish. "The NCB officials had sought his custody for examination in the case," an official has said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The NCB had recently arrested seven persons in two cases in which 27 kg hashish was recovered. During investigation, it came to light that the narcotics drug was sourced from Jammu and Kashmir. Also, the alleged role of Kaskar, lodged in a Thane jail, surfaced in the case, following which his custody was sought.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"On perusal of the remand report and case diary, it appears that the case is of serious nature triable by special court. Hence, sufficient opportunity of investigation is required," the magistrate said, while handing over his custody to the NCB.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2017, the Anti-Extortion Cell of the Thane police had arrested Kaskar in connection with an extortion case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He had been deported from the United Arab Emirates in 2003. Kaskar was said to be operating his brother's real estate business in Mumbai. The Thane police had earlier booked him under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) Act.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[The train - 02414 - was going to Madgaon in Goa when it derailed inside Karbude tunnel, approximately 325 kms from Mumbai at around 4.15 am.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: Goa-bound Rajdhani Express from Hazrat Nizamuddin derailed inside a tunnel in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra early on Saturday, but there was no report of injury to any passenger, an official said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The train - 02414 - was going to Madgaon in Goa when it derailed inside Karbude tunnel, approximately 325 kms from Mumbai at around 4.15 am, a spokesperson of the Konkan Railway, which operates the route, said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He said that a boulder had fallen on the tracks, which led to the derailment. "The front wheel of the locomotive of Rajdhani superfast train derailed in Karbude tunnel located between Ukshi and Bhoke stations in Ratnagiri region of the Konkan Railway," the official said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A rail maintenance vehicle (RMV) has reached the site and an accident relief medical van (ARMV) having re-railing equipment has left for the site from Ratnagiri for the restoration work. "Konkan Railway officials have also rushed to the site to clear the line," he said.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Konkan Railway operates 756 km-long route between Roha near Mumbai and Thokur near Mangalore. This route, which is spread across three states - Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka - is one of the challenging terrains with many rivers, gorges and mountains.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[During the meeting, the party #39;s   IT cell  spotted two suspicious usernames - Mamata Banerjee and Joy Bangla - among the participants.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">KOLKATA: Functionaries of the BJP's West Bengal chapter were taken by surprise with the presence of "intruders" during the party's internal virtual meeting on Thursday evening. Acting upon the instruction from the party's central leadership, BJP Bengal unit organised the meeting to discuss the strategy of showcasing BJP-led central government's projects and schemes for people. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the meeting, the party's  IT cell, which provided technical support for the meeting involving state-level functionaries and all district presidents and general secretaries, spotted two suspicious usernames - Mamata Banerjee and Joy Bangla - among the participants.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as members of the IT cell started inquiring, several anti-BJP contents started pouring in the comment box. Sources in the BJP said someone among the participants must have shared the link of the meeting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"We are now searching the traitor(s) to avert re-run of similar incident of spying," said a BJP leader. The meeting was chaired by BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, vice-president Jayprakash Majumdar and other state functionaries along with district leaders.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The high-command had instructed us to give our functionaries a guideline for showcasing and campaigning all the positive measured that the BJP-led Centre initiated during the party's last seven-year tenure in the central government. It was completely an internal meeting," said another BJP leader.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Insiders in the party said the event started smoothly and the leaders were discussing about the strategy. "Some of our experts from the IT cell were also among the participants. Suddenly, the IT cell spotted two suspicious usernames. One is namesake of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and other used her pre-election slogan Jay Bangla. The IT cell immediately removed them," said the leader.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">BJP's general secretary in Bengal Sayantan Basu said the matter is being investigated.<br />

<title>Uttar Pradesh BJP drops rape convict MLA Kuldeep Sengar's kin as candidate for panchayat chief polls</title>

<description><![CDATA[In April, the BJP named Sengar #39;s wife Sangita as its supported candidate from one of the wards in district panchayat elections in Unnao but later withdrew her name after backlash.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">LUCKNOW: Ten months after he was convicted for raping a teenager and sentenced to life in prison and subsequently losing his state assembly membership, Kuldeep Sengar's shadow is still haunting the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With the 2017 Unnao rape survivor voicing concern over the BJP reposing its faith in the former MLA's kin for winning panchayat polls in Unnao district, the party has been compelled to roll back its decision twice in three months.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In April, the BJP named Sengar's wife Sangita as its supported candidate from one of the wards in district panchayat elections in Unnao. As the decision caused uproar and drew protests from the rape survivor, the party had to replace her.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">But two months later, it was again caught on the wrong foot on Thursday when it named the former MLA's close aide and distant relative Arun Singh as BJP candidate for next month's district panchayat chairperson polls in Unnao.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A few hours later, the rape survivor appealed against the decision to President Ram Nath Kovind, PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">She pointed out that Singh was one of the accused in the case registered in connection with the accident involving her car in July 2019, which killed her two aunts and inflicted serious injuries to her and her advocate.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Realising that the decision had rendered opportunity to its political opponents to target the party eight months before the assembly polls, the BJP changed its candidate despite Singh’s protests that he was given clean chit by the CBI.  </p>]]></story>

<title>Expand Congress' base without hurting Maharashtra government: Central leadership to Nana Patole</title>

<description><![CDATA[Patole, who was on a tour of north Maharashtra to expand the party base, was abruptly summoned to the national capital on Friday.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: Amid Congress' worsening ties with the Shiv Sena, the party's Maharashtra unit chief Nana Patole was asked by the central leadership on Friday to refrain from making controversial statements that could land the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in trouble, especially at a time when there's a strong buzz of the Sena turning soft towards the BJP. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Patole, who was on a tour of north Maharashtra to expand the party base, was abruptly summoned to the national capital on Friday. Some of his recent statements have not gone down well with the MVA allies and sparking concerns even within the party.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He had announced that the Congress would be going solo in future elections, prompting Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to lash out at the party. "The party leadership has asked Patole to expand the party base without hurting the incumbent government. The Congress wants the MVA to last its full five-year term. It does not want to lose a resourceful state like Maharashtra at this juncture when the party is struggling to float. It is in power in Punjab, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, but these states cannot be compared with Maharashtra," said a highly placed source.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, senior Congress leaders in the state are also unhappy with Maharashtra in-charge HK Patil for interfering in district-level appointments for party posts. "If he wants to do anything, he should convey a message through the state president or another senior state functionary. Patil recently sent a voice mail to all district units asking them to submit three names each for district president. It’s not his call to appoint Congress district presidents; it is the right of the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee. Patil is overstepping his brief," said a source.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Several complaint letters have gone to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking Patil's replacement, the source added.</p>]]></story>

<title>Jammu &amp; Kashmir wants restoration of statehood: Pakistan minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi</title>

<description><![CDATA[The Pakistan foreign minister said that the decision had resulted in the closure of almost 50 per cent of the industries in the Valley.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi holding a meeting of all political parties of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Friday said Kashmiris wanted restoration of statehood.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Terming Modi's claim of fulfilling the statehood demand as vague and against the wishes of Kashmiris, Qureshi said, "This (holding the meeting) was a failed attempt on part of the Indian Prime Minister to mend the tarnished image of his government following the illegal acts of revocation of special status of J&K."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The meeting almost lasted three hours. This was the first such meeting held after August 5, 2019 when the Centre had revoked Article 370 and ended the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir while bifurcating it into two union territories.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"India has exercised all tools of State oppression to curb the determination of Kashmiris, however it has failed to subjugate them," the Pakistan foreign minister said and added that the decision had resulted in the closure of almost 50 per cent of the industries in the Valley.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Since the step (revoking Article 370) would have far-reaching implications, Pakistan has highlighted the matter at highest fora including UNGA, UNSC, at the levels of PM and foreign minister at various bilateral talks and at the Geneva Council of Human Rights," he added.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[A  committee will be formed by J amp;K L-G Manoj Sinha, who will go through the list of remaining detainees on a case-to-case basis.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI:  The first steps towards removing "<em>Dil ki doori aur Dilli ki doori</em>" as PM Narendra Modi put it in his meeting with 14 leaders from J&K were taken well before their meeting on Thursday.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A few political leaders in detention were released days before the high-profile meeting was held in the capital and sources in Ministry of Home Affairs say that a committee will be formed by J&K L-G Manoj Sinha, who will go through the list of remaining detainees on a case-to-case basis. Release of more political detainees could be seen soon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The L-G will constitute a committee which will go through a list of 40 people who are in custody under the PSA. Most of them belong to political parties. Based on various factors and depending on the feedback from security agencies their release will be looked into," a source in the Ministry of Home Affairs told <em>The New Indian Express</em>. "Cases of those who were not charged with offences of violence will be reviewed," the sources added.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">BJP leader and former J&K deputy CM Nirmal Singh, who attended the meeting, said: "In the meeting, the home minister shared data of detainees under PSA who are still in custody. He said there are 40 people who are detained under the PSA, and he said their cases will be reviewed by a committee."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Release of political prisoners was one of the key demands made by various leaders, including Congress’s Ghulam Nabi Azad, in the meeting with the PM and Home Minister Amit Shah. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, in the run up to the meeting held on Thursday, several political detainees such as PDP’s Naeem Akhtar and Sartaj Madni were released last week. Akhtar was first detained in August 2019 and booked again under the PSA.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After being released in June 2020 he was again taken into custody in December last year. Madni, the uncle of former CM Mehbooba Mufti, was released after six months of detention on Saturday and a day later Akhtar was also released.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Experts have welcomed these developments. "In 2004 after the Hurriyat held two rounds of talks with the then deputy PM LK Advani, Advaniji asked them what it is that they want. They asked for the release of political prisoners. I think they gave a list of some 35 people of which the government ordered the release of around 12," said AS Dulat, the former R&AW chief.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Skandan Krishnan, a former IAS officer who served as an advisor to former J&K governor Satyapal Malik said "such a move will give the biggest fillip to the local parties".</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government issued fresh guidelines on Friday, warning local authorities not to ease restrictions immediately, following fears of a possible third wave and the spread of the Delta Plus variant.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">State chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, while issuing new guidelines, said the threat of the pandemic persists as deadlier variants are being reported. The state has so far reported 21 Delta Plus cases - nine in Ratnagiri and the rest from Jalgaon, Palghar and other districts.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"We need to impose stringent restrictions to curb the spread," he said, adding that given the mutations in the virus and its ongoing evolution, it is likely that more serious situations will arise in the near future. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The order said that while easing restrictions, weekly positivity index and percentage of oxygen-powered beds should be considered. "Weekly positivity rate should be determined on the basis of RT-PCR tests only," read the order. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Local administrations have been told to accelerate vaccination through public awareness activities. "Every effort should be made to complete the vaccination of at least 70 per cent of the eligible people as soon as possible. Besides, test-track-treat method should be adopted as much as possible to prevent the spread of COVID," he added.</p>]]></story>

<description><![CDATA[The oxygen audit report further said due to Delhi rsquo;s excessive demand, 12 other states had to face a shortage as supply was diverted to Delhi.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">NEW DELHI: Proposing an equitable formula for managing oxygen supply, the Supreme Court-constituted National Task Force (NTF) stressed that authorities must maintain strategic reserves for 2-3 weeks, like it is done for fuel by petrol stations, to manage the surge in COVID-19 cases in future.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">NTF said a 100-bed hospital should be allocated about 1.5 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen every day. Meanwhile, a committee constituted to see oxygen supply stated that Delhi needed about 300 MT at that time, but the Delhi government raised the demand to 1200 MT.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ALSO READ| <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/delhi/2021/jun/25/delhi-made-exaggerated-claims-for-oxygen-using-wrong-formula-sub-group-to-sc-2321370.html" target="_blank">Delhi made exaggerated claims for Oxygen using wrong formula: Sub-group to SC</a></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The oxygen audit report further said due to Delhi's excessive demand, 12 other states had to face a shortage as supply was diverted to Delhi.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The task force suggested measures to be taken to prevent a repeat of the crisis. The 12-member NTA lauded the Central government’s efforts, saying it took proactive steps last year to control the spread of the pandemic.The task force suggested oxygen monitoring committees be set up in every hospital.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Further, monitoring teams should be available to ensure proper assessment of need as per hospital protocol. The NTF was constituted to devise a formula oxygen allocation, after Delhi disputed the Centre’s methods.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The formula needs to be developed for the calculation of oxygen requirement for the primary, secondary, and tertiary-level hospitals based on the number of Oxygen beds and ICU beds," it said. For a 100-bed hospital with 25% ICU beds, the report stated that its daily requirement should be 1.5 MT.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chhattisgarh industries face shortage of iron ore</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Being the second-largest sponge iron producer in the country and the only state to make high-grade rails for the Railways, Chhattisgarh is facing an acute shortage of iron ore for its industries. The state produces 11.6 MTPA steel and 11.28 MTPA (25 per cent of India) sponge iron.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"We are deeply concerned as over 89 per cent, which is 24 million tonnes, of iron ore produced by the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC), the only commercial miner, is being exported outside the state, creating a huge scarcity," said Pradeep Tandon, chairman, state council of FICCI. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>16 senior Maoist leaders died of COVID-19 in 2 months</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Confirmation by the banned CPI (Maoist) of the death of two senior leaders due to the coronavirus infection, has corroborated the assertion of Bastar Police that the pandemic claimed the lives of over 16 senior rebels in the last two months.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bastar Range IG Sunderraj P has appealed to the Maoist cadres to shun violence, surrender, avail medical facilities and seek treatment for COVID-19 ailment. The pandemic situation in Maoist camps remains alarming.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Red ultras should accept the reality, the IG added. Most of the Maoist leaders and cadres have reportedly died in the proximity of the Minaguram-Jabagatta forest in the south Bijapur-Sukma region. Maoist leaders like Hidma, Vinod, Sonu, Jaiman, Nandu among others are reported to be down with the infection. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Support for 1.5 lakh amid second wave</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Bharat Aluminium Company (BALCO) has extended medical, awareness and livelihood support to over 1.5 lakh community members through various initiatives in the industrial town of Korba. The organisation has designed and implemented campaigns across villages on various do's and don'ts and supported the administration with medicines, sanitisation drive and PPE kits.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the challenging time, it has set up a 100-bed hospital at Naya Raipur and generated livelihood opportunities through Vedanta skill school and project ‘Unnati’. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>500 schools closed due to pandemic impact</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Private schools in Chhattisgarh are the worst hit by the pandemic impact. As many as 500 schools <br />
have already been shut down in the state and many others are on the brink of closure as they are unable to sustain the expenses.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest concern is the fate of one lakh students who were admitted in these schools from Class 1 to 8 under the Right to Education (RTE). According to Rajiv Gupta, president of the Private School Association, there are around 500 private schools that were shut down owing to financial constraints and lack of enough admissions.</p>]]></story>

<title>Debt-to-GDP ratio swells to 58.73 per cent for FY 2020-21</title>

<description><![CDATA[According to a finance ministry report, the government #39;s total debt reached Rs 116.2 lakh crore as on 31 March 2021, registering a 6.36 per cent jump in the January-March quarter.]]></description>
<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI:  In another sign of the country's worsening fiscal situation, the Central government's total debt at the end of financial year 2020-21 has reached 58.73 per cent of the GDP, the highest since 2007-08 when the debt-to-GDP ratio was 58.86 per cent.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The government's total debt reached Rs 116.2 lakh crore as on 31 March 2021, registering a 6.36 per cent jump in the January-March quarter, according to a finance ministry report. At the end of December 2020, total debt stood at Rs 109.2 lakh crore.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2019-20, the ratio was 48.6 per cent. The government’s total market borrowings also exceeded the revised budget estimate of Rs 12.74 lakh crore for FY21. The government had to borrow Rs 13.20 lakh crore to finance a part of the fiscal deficit of Rs 18.21 lakh crore. Rest of the fiscal deficit is financed by money collected through small savings schemes and external assistance. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">During the January-March quarter of 2020-21, the Centre issued government bonds worth Rs 3,20,349 crore against Rs 76,000 crore in the year-ago quarter. Consequently, the rate at which the government borrowed during the fourth quarter also increased from 5.68 per cent in the October-December 2020 quarter to 5.80%. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Yields on government securities hardened in the secondary market due to increase in supply of G-secs during the quarter. Further, hardening of yields was more on the short end of curve due to increase in weekly borrowing and also announcement of resumption of normal liquidity operations by the RBI," the Finance Ministry report said. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Public debt</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The country's total public debt (Centre and States) is likely to have touched 90 per cent of the GDP in 2020-21, the highest ever recorded. In 2019-20, the total public debt to GDP ratio was 70 per cent.</p>]]></story>

<story><![CDATA[<p>NEW DELHI: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the delimitation exercise and holding of peaceful elections in Jammu and Kashmir are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The home minister's comments came after a three-and-half-hour-long meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with 14 political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir, including four former chief ministers. "We are committed to ensure all round development of J&K. The future of Jammu and Kashmir was discussed and the delimitation exercise and peaceful elections are important milestones in restoring statehood as promised in Parliament," Shah said in a tweet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He said Thursday's meeting on Jammu and Kashmir was held in a very cordial environment. "Everyone expressed their commitment to democracy and the Constitution. It was stressed to strengthen the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir," Shah said in another tweet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The four former chief ministers of the erstwhile state who participated in the discussions were Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah of the National Conference, Congress' Ghulam Nabi Azad and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Four former deputy chief ministers were in attendance too - Congress' Tara Chand, People's Conference leader Muzaffar Hussain Baig and BJP's Nirmal Singh and Kavinder Gupta.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">CPM leader Mohammed Yusuf Tarigami, Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) chief Altaf Bukhari, Sajjad Lone of the People's Conference, J-K Congress head G A Mir, BJP's Ravinder Raina and Panthers Party leader Bhim Singh also formed part of the delegation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the first interaction between the central leadership and mainstream parties since August 5, 2019, when the Centre revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.</p>]]></story>
