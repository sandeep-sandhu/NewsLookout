<p><strong><em>This is a Guest Post by Kishan Jain, Director at Goldmedal Electricals</em></strong></p>



<p>The impact of the pandemic has caused disruption in the lives of every individual across the globe and has transformed the way we live. The pandemic has, however, led to an increased adoption of digital technologies in day-to-day functioning. </p>



<p>The shift toward contactless technology solutions has also seen a growth and the segment has been expanding over the years, especially with the invention of voice-controlled devices. The COVID-19 pandemic created a trigger to move away from physical touch, alerting the world on the potential invisible risks. </p>



<p>This fear has forced an acceleration for a touch-free experience that is now stirring as a practice in everyday lives. This demand is bringing innovative offerings as brands strive to eliminate any risks that could generate fear among the consumers.Â </p>



<p>With increasing access to contactless digital accessibility and connected appliances combined with the adoption of work from home culture, there has been an uptick in the demand for IoT based home automation products and solutions among the consumers. </p>



<p>Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) are also taking a centre stage as these technologies are set to change the face of the world.</p>



<h2><strong>Building a healthy and safe environment</strong></h2>



<p>Today, hygiene measures and health care have become the topmost priority and the pandemic has put the spotlight on contactless technology. </p>



<p>With the installation of products equipped with contactless technology such as smart switches, smart lights, smart television sets, video intercoms, alarm panels and others, there has been an increase in the number of homes expanding the use of technology to manage temperature, lighting, and maintain security. </p>



<p>This has resulted in the consumers getting accustomed to the comfort of operating with contactless technology in their domestic life and expect a similar practice in the office. This change in lifestyle has pushed the growth of smart buildings that will offer an increased focus on well-being and safety in the workplace. Smart offices will consist of automated systems that simplify building operations, from air conditioning and heating to illumination and protection. </p>



<p>Buildings with smart and contactless technology can boost a safer and healthier space for an organisationâs environment and sustainability.Â </p>



<h2><strong>Partner for senior citizens</strong></h2>



<p>Contactless technology is also becoming the most desirable technology for senior citizens as it enhances their lifestyle by ushering convenience at an affordable price. Contactless technology allows senior citizens to access all appliances and gadgets without being physically present or the need for moving from one place to another. </p>



<p>For senior citizens, especially those who live alone, an entirely automated home is an absolute helping hand. There is a smart solution for all their requirements without compromising their quality of life. All devices from doorbells to lights to home appliances are accessible through mobile apps, remote controls, or voice-activated assistants like Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, making it extremely convenient for them to stay independent.</p>



<p>These smart technologies illustrate some of the trends that will unfold as a daily practice in the new normal. </p>



<p>Voice assistants, Infrared scanning and temperature sensors, face recognition, self-cleaning locations are among the most popular contactless technology. Consumers have demonstrated that contactless technology plays a major role in the way we live, purchase products, and obtain information. </p>



<p>Today, taking measures to maintain hygiene and sanitation have become an integral part of our lives and companies are offering unique and innovative products &amp; solutions that bring comfort and security to the consumers. In addition to safety, contactless technology is discarding the requirement for manual effort and offering seamless implementation to everyday tasks. </p>



<p>In the post-Covid world, contactless technology will not only simplify everyday tasks but also offer a sense of safety and security to all.Â </p>

<p>More than 50 lakh central government employees and more than 65 lakh pensioners will be receiving a hike of up to 28% in their Dearness Allowance, as revealed by the newest updates about the 7th pay commission.<br></p>



<p>Read on to find out all the details about this hike in the DA for government employees and pensioners!<br></p>



<h2><strong>50 Lakh Central Govt Employees Will Get 28% More DA, Salary In July</strong><br></h2>



<p>In July, more than 50 lakh central government employees and more than 65 lakh pensioners will be receiving a hike of up to 28 percent in Dearness Allowance. This number was previously 17 percent only.<br></p>



<p>As per the data released by the All India Consumer Price Index (AICPI), at least DA can be increased by 4 percent between January and June 2021.<br></p>



<p>This also includes a 3 percent increase in DA from January to June 2020, a 4 percent increase from July to December 2020, and a 4 percent increase from January to June 2021. The total DA calculation results in 28 percent.<br></p>



<p>The 7th CPC Fitment Factor of 2.57 will also be taken into account while calculating the probable hike in monthly salary. For instance, if the monthly basic salary of an employee is Rs 21,000 then his monthly 7th CPC salary hike will be Rs 51,400 (Rs 20,000 x 2.57).<br></p>



<h2><strong>Will Employees Receive Arrears?</strong><br></h2>



<p>As we all know, three installments of DA were frozen on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed for all central government employees and DR for pensioners, which were due on January 1, 2020, July 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>As per Thakur, âAs and when the decision to release the future installments of Dearness Allowance due from July 1, 2021 is taken, the rates of DA as effective from January 1 and July 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021 will be restored prospectively and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rates effective from July 1, 2021.â<br></p>



<p>As we reported to you earlier, any increase in the DA from July 1 will only be effective from that day. This means that employees will not be receiving any arrears on non revision of DA for previous period.<br></p>



<p>A 4 percent increase for government employees and a 21 percent increase for pensioners was approved by the Union Cabinet, which was to be implemented from January 1, 2020. As of now, Central government employees are being paid DA of 17 percent.</p>

<p>PUBG Corporation confirmed it will be putting up an Indian subsidiary and will launch a game in line with the Indian culture. PUBG Mobile India release could happen sometime in the next two months. Recently the corporation in India also posted a new job listing on LinkedIn for the India subsidiary, an Investment and Strategy Analyst who will be responsible for mergers and acquisitions in the country.

<p>As of now PUBG has six job listings listed under PUBG Corporation, hinting at relaunch of PUBG Mobile India.<br></p>



<p>YouTuber GodNixon aka Luv Sharma claiming that the Indian government has approved PUBG Mobile India launch. He said the sources close to the development have confirmed the government giving a green signal to PUBG Mobile India launch.<br></p>



<p>Recently the makers Krafton Inc said that they are in talks with Indian government and awaiting their approvals for PUBG Mobile India relaunch. Krafton communications representative said that they are awaiting for Indian governmentâs consideration and decision.<br></p>



<p>Just a few days back Krafton also said PUBG Mobile India release will happen, and it&#8217;s very much on cards. Krafton is hopeful about PUBG&#8217;s comeback in India and working hard to release the Indian version of PUBG Mobile in the country. Kraftonâs corporate development boss Sean Hyunil Sohn at a recent event said it&#8217;s working hard to make a comeback. PUBG Mobile India launch will happen.<br></p>



<p>PUBG Mobile India was teased back in November during Diwali, but it has been repeatedly delayed due to issues with the Indian government. Banned amid the border tensions with China, the government is yet to grant permission to Krafton to release PUBG Mobile India in the country.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The company head made it pretty clear that they very much care about Indian market and are working hard to make it happen. We don&#8217;t have an official PUBG Mobile India release date, but it&#8217;s for sure the makers are trying their every bit to release the game in India. Krafton recently said that their latest PUBG: New State will release only after PUBG Mobile India launches in the country.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>So, PUBG: New State India launch will happen, but after PUBG Mobile India is released in India. The upcoming battle royale game is said not to be made available in India once released globally.<br></p>



<p>Krafton was quoted saying in a report by a South Korean website <em>The Guru</em> that they are not planning to launch New State in India yet. Currently PUBG New State India pre-registrations are closed.<br></p>



<p>While the PUBG: New State in India the listing is visible, nobody is allowed to register. Krafton said it is currently focusing on the launch of PUBG Mobile India first, the Indian version of PUBG Mobile, so PUBG New State India launch depends on when the former game is released.<br></p>



<p>Recently Krafton released the PUBG New State trailer. The company is working on to launch the game soon, expected to be rolled out in 2021 only.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The upcoming PUBG upgrade with the new game will continue with the same PUBG legacy but in a different setting in the future. Called PUBG: New State, it&#8217;s expected to roll out in a few months globally. PUBG: New State pre-registrations are now live, and Android users can register for the new battle royale game. Krafton also released a gameplay trailer for you to understand how the upcoming PUBG game will look.</p>

<p>The companies have been forced down <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/business-economy/companies/article/tcs-infosys-itc-among-others-back-to-full-wfh-mode-amid-covid-surge-ask-employees-to-prioritise-health/747334" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">to revise their plans of phased working from the office</a> due to the potency of <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/20/deloitte-will-hire-75000-staff-in-india-confident-over-recovery-of-economy-from-covid19/" data-wpel-link="internal">Covid-19âs</a> second wave along withÂ  localized lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus infections. <br></p>



<h2><strong>Insist On Working From Home</strong><br></h2>



<p>Regardless of sectors and regions, now companies are asking their white-collar staff to go back to full work from home (WFH) mode.<br></p>



<p>This is happening for cities who are not even under Covid restrictions.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Large scale companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, ITC, IBM, Raymond, InMobi, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Deloitte, SAP India, Dunzo and others have asked their employees to start WFH.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Also, firms are offering support and sending out WFH advisories, not only to staff in the most affected states, but also in other regions as a precautionary measure.<br></p>



<h2><strong>IT Firms Asking Work From Home</strong><br></h2>



<p>Going ahead the IT major, Infosys has advised employees not to venture out of their home, in an email to its staff by the chief operating officer Pravin Rao.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>ââ¦do not leave your homes without wearing a protective mask, practice social distancing, and avoid crowds â¦ We request you not to venture out unless itâs an emergency,â he said.</p>



<p>Other IT giants like TCS and IBM have asked employees to continue WFH until June end.<br></p>



<p>On the other hand, SAP India Labs asked their employees to work from remote locations, including the near 10 per cent workforce who has recently started going to the office.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Apart from that the SAP India Labs has also started a <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/21/free-vaccine-for-all-above-18-in-these-two-states-maharashtra-will-import-vaccines/" data-wpel-link="internal">Covid-19 vaccination programme</a> for eligible employees from its Bengaluru campus.</p>



<h2><strong>Other Industries Take On Work From Home</strong><br></h2>



<p>Not only IT, but the cigarettes to packaged consumer goods conglomerate, ITC has also closed its offices and further advised employees to continue WFH.<br></p>



<p>In addition to that, no one was allowed inside its office without any prior permission.<br></p>



<p>Similarly, the president, HR, Raymond, KA Narayan said âWe were proactive in taking precautionary measures and advised our office staff total work from home starting April 5. We will continue with this measure till the situation gets under control,â.<br></p>



<p>While Motilal Oswal Financial Services has once again instructed its majority of the&nbsp; employees across the country to WFH.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Saying âEven though stock market operations come under essential servicesâ¦ we have minimised staff presence in office to only essential functions,â.<br></p>



<p>At the same time, India reported 2,59,170 new coronavirus infections and 1,761 deaths in the last 24 hours, as per the data from the Union Health Ministry.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>&nbsp;Starting May 1, the government has allowed <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/20/vaccine-allowed-to-every-adult-from-may-1-key-highlights-regarding-vaccination-drive/" data-wpel-link="internal">Covid vaccination for all above 18 years of age</a>, and also these doses can be sold via the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Poco M3 Pro 5G launch in India could happen soon as the handset with the model number M2103K19PG has been spotted on both BIS and FCC certification, and BIS listing does suggest an imminent India launch.<br></p>



<p>The smartphone recently surfaced on TENAA, spotted by popular tipster Digital Chat Station. The certification hints at the global release soon.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Poco M3 Pro Specs: Poco M3 Pro 5G Specs, Features (Note 10 5G)</strong></h2>



<p>Redmi Note 10 5G is said to launch in India as a rebranded Poco M3 Pro 5G. So, the specs are expected to remain the same in the country. The listing previously leaked shows the same design, 6.5-inch 90Hz IPS display, 5,000 mAh battery and 48MP main camera. The only difference remains with the charging speed on the listing, it&#8217;s 22.5W instead of 18W. So, the global Redmi Note 10 5G could vary in terms of a few features compared to the Chinese variant.<br></p>



<p>The phone will ship with MediaTek Dimensity 700 SoC paired with Mali-G57 MC2 GPU, 4GB RAM, 128GB UFS 2.2 internal storage and is further expandable via an external memory card.<br></p>



<p>Given the listing, Redmi Note 10 5G may come bundled with the 18W charger and not a 22.5W charger.<br></p>



<p>In India, all the Redmi Note 10 phones come with 33W fast chargers, while Redmi Note 9 came with the 22.5W charger. The device may get a slot for May release for the global units, in India as Poco M3 Pro 5G.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Poco M3 Pro India Launch: Poco M3 Pro Price In India, Availability</strong></h2>



<p>Poco M3 Pro India launch could happen in May, expected soon given the device already received BIS certification. Redmi Note 10 5G launch globally could happen soon including India. In the country it could come as Poco M3 Pro 5G, the first 5G phone from the brand. Poco M3 Pro Flipkart availability will also be confirmed once officially announced.<br></p>



<p>Poco M3 Pro price in India is expected to start at the same price bracket as the predecessor. Poco M3 Pro 5G price may start at under Rs 15,000 in the country for the base model with 5G connectivity.</p>

<p>With all the hype in the pandemic and job situation in the job market, getting a job is tough for engineers in India nowadays.</p>



<p> <br>But no worries there as this skills can give you an edge over other candidates, yes â we are talking about, <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/01/15/this-is-how-saas-will-get-disrupted-in-2021-5-emerging-trends-for-saas/" data-wpel-link="internal">set of skills, SaaS-y skills</a>. <br></p>



<h2><strong>Potential Career Opportunity For Engineers</strong><br></h2>



<p>So far, Indian <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/careers/news/for-saas-y-salaries-indian-engineers-are-skipping-the-traditional-it-services-queue/articleshow/82157280.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">software-as-a-service (SaaS) market</a> is at its beginning stage and considered as young.<br></p>



<p>However, this is the domain where the real money lies, for an engineer.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Currently, demand is overflowing in this segment and could be considered a side effect of the COVID-19 pandemicâs âdigital transformationâ wave.<br></p>



<p>According to the director and head of talent strategy at venture capital company Lightspeed Venture Partners,&nbsp; Siddharth Sangwan, âCOVID-related trail winds have led to a massive leverage using technology and that in turn leading firms to look at incrementing their teams with high quality engineers,â.<br></p>



<p>On top of that the salaries in SaaS firms are at least 30% higher than traditional IT services, as confirmed by the Recruitment firm TeamLease.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Better Growth For SaaS Firm</strong><br></h2>



<p>âThe potential for growth is better as a SaaS firm because product development on this platform is more robust and exposure to technology is higher. Whereas in traditional IT service companies, they tend to stick to one project for longer durations,â explained Siva Prasad Nanduri, the vice president and business head of IT Staffing at TeamLease Digital.</p>



<h2><strong>Five SaaS Skills In Demand</strong><br></h2>



<p>According to the chief executive officer (CEO) of Quess IT Staffing, Vijay Sivaram, âOrganisations are looking to hire talent with bundled skill sets, rather than just one skill, driving up the salary expectations and offers in the market,â.<br></p>



<p>To make it robust, having at least two years of experience is all you need to capitalise on your <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/16/1-97-lakh-wipro-employees-will-get-2nd-salary-hike-in-this-month-skill-based-bonuses-announced-for-senior-employees/" data-wpel-link="internal">skillset</a>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Remember that your knowledge is what companies are looking for when they are <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/15/tcs-will-hire-40000-more-freshers-experienced-staff-this-year-they-just-created-new-hiring-record/" data-wpel-link="internal">hiring</a>.<br></p>



<p>So it doesnt which sector you were in, or what brand you were working on.<br></p>



<p>But, just having the right set of skills is not enough as a potential employee must also know how to use those skills to get the job done.<br></p>



<p>This thought was mentioned by Sirion Labs, a contract life-cycle management company having clients like Vodafone, Unilever, Credit Suisse, and EY, agrees that experience is key.<br></p>



<p>While talking about the skill, the co-founder and CEO of SirionLabs, Ajay Agrawal noted that âWhen it comes to technical hires specialising in AI/ analytics/data science, we look for top talent with practical experience in NLP, streaming applications (Kafka, Rabbitmq), and programming languages such as Python and R,â.<br></p>



<p>In this race of hiring, the traditional companies, startups and small business firms are showing equal interest and willing to offer more money.<br></p>



<p>So this could be considered a game changer for an individual and masses seeking employment.<br></p>

<p>Right now, Indiaâs top priority is vaccination for all, and some concrete steps have been taken to ensure that more and more Indians are vaccinated, and the pandemic is controlled.<br></p>



<p>In this endeavor, two very important developments have taken place: Due to shortage of vaccines, Maharashtra has announced that they will import vaccine shots from other countries.<br></p>



<p>And two states: Uttar Pradesh and Assam have declared free vaccines for all adult citizens.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Free Vaccine For All Above 18 In UP And Assam</strong><br></h2>



<p>As soon as Govt of India allowed everyone to have vaccine from May 1st, two states have come out and declared that every citizen above 18 years will get free vaccines: UP and Assam<br></p>



<p>As per Govt of Indiaâs vaccine announcement, free vaccine is only for those who are aged above 45 years, and for healthcare, and frontline workers. Hence, as per the Centreâs vaccination drive, 18-45 year old Indians need to pay for the vaccine.<br></p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="hi" dir="ltr">?????? ?????????????, <br><br>?? ??????????? ?? ???? ??? ?? ?????? ???? ??? ?? ?? ????? ?????? ??? 18 ???? ?? ???? ??? ?? ??? ????????????? ?? ?????? ??????? <a href="https://twitter.com/UPGovt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@UPGovt</a> ?????? ???????? ????? ??????<br><br>?????? ??????, ???? ??????&#8230;</p>&mdash; Yogi Adityanath (@myogiadityanath) <a href="https://twitter.com/myogiadityanath/status/1384545498430795780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">April 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>But State Governments are free to roll out free vaccines, as per their quota and their schemes.<br></p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assam will give FREE vaccines to everyone from 18-45 years. GOI is giving free vaccines for 45 +. <br><br>Funds collected in Assam Arogya Nidhi last year shall be utilized for procurement of vaccines. <br><br>Today itself, weâve placed orders for 1 cr doses with <a href="https://twitter.com/BharatBiotech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@BharatBiotech</a>.<a href="https://twitter.com/PMOIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@PMOIndia</a> <a href="https://t.co/U6hutOEOhg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U6hutOEOhg</a></p>&mdash; Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) <a href="https://twitter.com/himantabiswa/status/1384549097617510402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">April 20, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>This is why both UP and Assam has now declared that every adult citizen in their respective states will get free vaccines.<br></p>



<p>Assam has already ordered 1 crore vaccines from Bharat Biotech.<br></p>



<p>This massive vaccination drive will be conducted under Phase 3, starting from May 1st.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Maharashtra Will Import Vaccine</strong><br></h2>



<p>Meanwhile Maharashtra, which is the worst hit state in terms of active and new cases, has announced that they will import vaccines from other countries.<br></p>



<p>Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said, &#8220;We have decided to cut the expenses of all the departments and divert the funds for vaccine procurement. We will not limit our plans only to the two vaccines that are manufactured in the country (Covishield and Covaxin)â<br></p>



<p>Itâs expected that Maharashtra Govt will try to procure Sputnik V, Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and make their vaccination drive faster.<br></p>



<p>Sputnik vaccine from Russia has already been approved by Govt.<br></p>



<p>We will keep you updated, as more details come in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TransUnion Cibil <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/banks-get-new-tool-to-assess-new-to-credit-customers/articleshow/82160758.cms?from=mdr" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">has developed</a> an eligibility score for potential credit customers who have no experience carrying debt or using credit cards.<br></p>



<p>The country&#8217;s oldest credit assessment firm is looking to tap into the market of under 40 years of age demographic who have no formal credit history.<br></p>



<h2><strong>An Emerging Borrower Class</strong><br></h2>



<p>These people have never taken out loans nor have they extensively used credit cards, yet are on the lookout for loans.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This new to credit (NTC) group was traditionally difficult to assess given their lack of formal credit history.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>However, they are also the fastest growing group of borrowers which banks want to tap into despite wariness about their default probability.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2><strong>The New Scoring Model</strong><br></h2>



<p>The new assessment or scoring model is called CreditVision which will make use of an algorithm to consistently monitor subjects.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The algorithm will pick up on behavioral trends and capture any shifts, thereby helping lenders determine the risk level of young borrowers who are open to taking on debt.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>CreditVision score range is from 101 to 200. The higher the value, lower is the credit risk or default probability of the borrower.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The model will be accessible only by credit institutions and banks.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2><strong>Growing From Credit-Inexperienced To âPrime Consumersâ</strong><br></h2>



<p>In an official statement, the firm has said that in the past 20 years the opening of 8.10 crore loan accounts of first-time borrowers was facilitated with its insights and solutions.<br></p>



<p>Analysis by the company has determined that NTC customers tend to be reliable and low risk.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>When they are given credit opportunities, they are able to build a higher credit score.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>72.30% of NTC consumers granted credit in Jan 2019 leveled up to become prime-consumers i.e. having a score of 700 and above, in Jan 2020.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Features Of The New And Young Indian Borrower</strong><br></h2>



<p>Analyses also found that in the 2-year period between Jan 2019 and Jan 2021, most NTC customers sought loans for 2-wheelers, consumer durables and home loans.<br></p>



<p>Rajesh Kumar, CEO TransUnion Cibil, said that most of the Indian population is under 40 years of age and this cohort is also most likely to fall under the NTC bracket.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>If this group is supported in terms of credit opportunities, they can turn out to be good borrowers and can develop into &#8220;a profitable customer base for credit institutions&#8221;, Kumar concluded.<br></p>



<p>Presently 24% of loan enquiries are made by NTC individuals hailing from rural and semi urban areas.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Wipro is rolling out <a href="https://content.techgig.com/wipro-to-roll-out-second-salary-hike-for-1-97-lakh-employees/articleshow/82146437.cms" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">another salary hike</a> in an attempt toward employee retention, a mission the firm calls its &#8220;war for talent&#8221;.<br></p>



<p>The hike is one measure among others such as promotions and skill-based bonuses, aimed at leading the competition for diverse and skilled talent.<br></p>



<h2><strong>2nd Hike In Under 6 Months</strong><br></h2>



<p>This is the second time an increment was announced after this January when pay hikes were distributed for 80% of its workforce.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The second hike will come into effect from this June.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>This hike will likely affect margins with flat sequential growth for the March quarter.<br></p>



<p>Despite a turbulent 2020 the firm had announced a single-digit salary hike back in October for a majority 80% of its employees, which would come into effect that December.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2><strong>Talent Retention</strong><br></h2>



<p>Wiproâs Chief Human Resources, Saurabh Govil, has said that the hikes are a regular part of the company&#8217;s promotional cycle.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>He corroborated the January announcement of salary hikes and said that junior employees would be included in the promotion cycles as was done in December.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The same would be repeated in June.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>For senior employees, the firm will be rolling out skill-based bonuses and hikes as well.<br></p>



<p>In June, the hikes will be added to senior employee salaries as skill-based bonuses<br></p>



<p>Wipro has big challenges ahead as it faces an attrition rate that is rising at a concerning rate.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h2><strong>Tackling Attrition</strong><br></h2>



<p>As of March 31 the attrition rate for Wipro was 12.1%, a jump from 11% in Q3 FY21; with a total headcount of 1.97 lakh.<br></p>



<p>The causes can be attributed to high demand and requirement for niche talents.<br></p>



<p>The Indian tech giant is also looking to increase its hiring of talent which specialises in the pandemic-driven popular digital skills of cloud services, IoT, cyber security,,etc.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Hiring was ramped up during the 3rd and 4th quarter with the induction of 9,000 freshers and 6,000 laterals, taking the net addition of employees to 15,000.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>18,000 new employees were hired in the quarter that ended in March.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>The company will renew its aggressive hiring efforts across the US, Europe and India in the new quarter.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>Amid the plummeting Covid-19 cases across the country, the United Statesâ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued an advisory on Tuesday, asking its citizens to avoid travelling to India at all cases, despite being fully vaccinated.</p>



<p>This came shortly after the United Kingdom added India to its âred listâ late on Monday, banning entry of Indians into the UK, effective Friday 3am.</p>



<p>Hong Kong too has banned entry of<a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/19/indigo-spicejet-air-asia-will-not-charge-money-for-changing-travel-dates-is-this-helpful/" data-wpel-link="internal"> passenger flights from India</a>, along with Pakistan and the Philippines, while activating an âemergency circuit breakerâ late on Sunday, effective for 14 days starting from April 20.</p>



<p>New Zealand on April 8 announced suspension of entry for Indian travellers in the country, effective from April 11 to April 28.</p>



<p>More and more countries are restricting <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/02/11/flying-abroad-these-covid-19-tests-are-mandatory-for-all-travellers-full-list-of-49-nations-the-rules/" data-wpel-link="internal">international travels for Indian nationals</a>, in compliance with the increasing Covid-19 cases in the country.</p>



<p>It has been reported that the main reason for countries banning air travel from India is the surging number of fresh cases in the country, in addition to citing a mutated strain of coronavirus from India.<br></p>



<h2>Travel Bans from Different Countries</h2>



<p>India recorded 2,59,170 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, taking the countryâs total Covid-19 toll to 1,53,21,089. On Wednesday, the country recorded 2,95,041 fresh infection cases, along with 2,023 deaths, reports IndiaTV.</p>



<p>Amidst the skyrocketing number of cases, the <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/06/covid-19-digital-pass-now-accepted-in-singapore-20-airlines-testing-this-seamless-travel-pass/" data-wpel-link="internal">international community</a> has started to ban India for travel.</p>



<p>It started on April 8, when New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced in a news conference that entry of travellers from India would be suspended from April 11 to April 28, as 17 out of 23 new Covid cases reported at the countryâs border, came from India.</p>



<p>Following this, Hong Kong on April 18 activated an âemergency circuit breakerâ, banning passenger flights from India, besides Pakistan and the Philippines for 14 days, effective April 20.</p>



<p>The three banned countries are classified as âextremely high riskâ, after Hong Kong saw multiple Covid positive cases in the country from <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-why-countries-are-restricting-travel-to-and-from-india-7281247/lite/?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">travellers</a> of these three countries, in the past 14 days.</p>



<p>On April 19, the UK added India to its âred listâ, banning travel for Indian citizens, effective Friday 3 am. India shares travel ban restrictions from the UK, with 8 other countries, namely Pakistan, Bangladesh, Oman, the Philippines, Qatar, South Africa, the UAE and Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>Falling into the UKâs red list means that on <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/02/08/covid-19-passport-can-become-international-travel-pass-for-all-countries-how-will-it-work/" data-wpel-link="internal">entering</a> into the UK before 3am on April 23, you will have to self-isolate for 10 days in your place of residence, followed by taking a Covid-19 test on day two and day eight.</p>



<p>However, after 3am April 23, only a resident of the UK or Ireland, or a British citizen can enter the UK if they have been in India in the last 10 days, followed by complete hotel quarantine for 10 days from the time of arrival.</p>



<p>On April 20, the <a href="https://trak.in/tags/business/2021/04/19/25-of-entire-america-is-now-vaccinated-5800-vaccinated-people-got-infected-with-covid-19/" data-wpel-link="internal">US CDC issued an advisory</a>, advising its citizens to avoid travelling to India, even if they are fully vaccinated, stating that India has a high Covid-19 count.</p>



<p>It has stated, âBecause of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India. If you must travel to India, get fully vaccinated before travel. All travellers should wear a mask, stay 6 feet from others, avoid crowds, and wash their hands.â<br></p>

<p>Hyundai has huge plans for the future! The automobile manufacturer is all set to launch some new SUVs and MPVs in the Indian market.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Read on to find out which cars will be launched by Hyundai in the recent future!<br></p>



<h2><strong>Hyundai Alcazar</strong><br></h2>



<p>The Hyundai Alcazar will be launched in the Indian market by June 2021 and the price will be announced at the time of the launch; this will make it the brandâs first three-row SUV that will be sold in India after a very long time. Hyundai India has announced that the car will be based on the Hyundai Creta and will be pitted against MG Hector Plus, Mahindra XUV500, and Tata Safari. It will come with two engine options â a 159PS, 2.0L petrol engine and a 113bhp, 1.5L turbo-charged diesel engine.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Hyundai AX1</strong><br></h2>



<p>The sub-four-meter SUV by Hyundai with the code name AX1 was spotted on the roads last year November with heavy camouflage. The micro-SUV might be based on the K1 architecture as the new Santro. The testing mule was spotted with a split headlight cluster in the front and at the rear, sculpted tailgate, and wraparound LED tail lamps. The car is expected to be powered by a 1.2-litre 4-cylinder naturally-aspirated petrol engine. While powering the i10 Nios, this engine produces 82bhp and 114Nm of torque.<br></p>



<h2><strong>Hyundai Tucson</strong><br></h2>



<p>The next gen Hyundai Tucson is scheduled to be launched in India in 2022. While there is no news about the launch timeline of the car but is already available in international markets in two variants &#8211; long-wheelbase and short-wheelbase variant. India will probably get the long wheel base variant.<br></p>



<p>Additionally, the variant that will be launched in India will come with&nbsp; the 2.5-litre inline 4-cylinder petrol engine producing 190bhp and 260Nm of torque and will be paired with an 8-speed automatic gearbox.<br></p>



<h2><strong>New Hyundai MPV</strong><br></h2>



<p>Hyundaiâs new MPV will be based on the new Cretaâs platform, and will be a multiple purpose vehicle for India and other Asian markets as well. If the engine is similar to Creta, the engine options on the car will be petrol, diesel, hybrid and electric. The price of the car will be something between the Maruti Ertiga and the Toyota Innova. The engine on the car will come in two options &#8211; a 113bhp, 1.5L naturally-aspirated petrol and a 113bhp, 1.5-litre turbocharged diesel.<br></p>



<h2><strong>New Hyundai Elantra</strong><br></h2>



<p>Hyundai Elantra will be launching the next generation of the Elantra by the end of 2022. The car will come with Hyundaiâs new Sensouous Sportiness design theme, hybrid electric technology and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. The car will reportedly be 2.2 inches longer and 1 inch wider, and the height will be reduced by 0.8 inch. The car might also come with&nbsp; the 2.0-litre petrol engine in the Indian market.<br></p>

<p>OnePlus Watch launched at Rs 16,999, but is now available at an introductory price of Rs 14,999. You can get the OnePlus Watch at Rs 12,999 with SBI credit cards.<br></p>



<p>OnePlus Watch comes with a 46mm circular dial, Warp Charge fast charging support, multiple fitness modes, 5ATM, IP68 certification and more.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>It&#8217;s the first smartwatch from OnePlus. It is available via Amazon India and the OnePlus online store.<br></p>



<h2><strong>OnePlus Watch Pros &amp; Cons: Should You Buy?</strong></h2>



<p>We will be keeping it short and crisp. While most of us know of the specs, let&#8217;s checkout whether the OnePlus Watch does justice with the price it&#8217;s asking for.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Body, Build: Too Big?</strong></h3>



<p>OnePlus Watch comes in two variants: Classic Stainless Steel and Cobalt Limited Edition. The circular dial is 46mm in size and. Do note, it&#8217;s a large watch, and doesn&#8217;t have a smaller dial to choose from. It has a unibody design, and the Stainless Steel variant has a glossy finish on the display bezel. OnePlus Watch Stainless Steel version will come with a 316L Stainless Steel case in Midnight Silver and Midnight Black colours.<br></p>



<p>Okay, it&#8217;s premium. OnePlus Watch does stand out in the crowd. You can feel it when you wear it, and the premiumness is there.<br></p>



<p>No way it feels less than an Apple Watch, and thankfully OnePlus went with a circular dial and didn&#8217;t copy the Apple Watch shape. There&#8217;s a OnePlus Watch Cobalt Limited Edition as well. It will come with a Cobalt Alloy Case in Gold.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Specs, Features: Worth It?</strong></h3>



<p>OnePlus Watch bsports a 2.5D curved glass AMOLED display. The smartwatch by OnePlus comes with 4GB of onboard storage and the company is also said to be pushing an update for an always-on-display option. You can make calls, store music. The speaker is quite loud, and good enough to answer calls and converse.<br></p>



<p>OnePlus Watch has 5ATM and is IP68 certified for water and dust resistance. OnePlus Watch supports blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring, stress detection, rapid heart rate alert and such more useful features.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h3><strong>Health, Fitness: All In One?</strong></h3>



<p>The OnePlus Watch has all the fitness features you would want on a smartwatch. It automatically detects when you start to jog and run. OnePlus Watch supports 110 workout / fitness modes as walking, jogging, running, marathon, outdoor cycling, indoor cycling, freestyle training, swimming, badminton, and more. We need to dig in more to understand how accurate are the results.<br></p>



<p>The Watch users can track all their health data on the OnePlus Health app.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Battery, Backup: Fair Enough?</strong></h3>



<p>OnePlus Watch can offer up to two weeks of battery on a full charge and it supports Warp Charge fast charging. It will offer a week&#8217;s power in 20 minutes of charge and a day&#8217;s power in five minutes. Given day to day usage, we didn&#8217;t face any issue with both charging and use. It&#8217;s good enough to run for a week given you will use most of the features.<br></p>



<p>On full charge it will run for two weeks and there&#8217;s support for Warp Charge fast charging as well.<br></p>



<h3><strong>OnePlus Watch Cons: What Are The Negatives?</strong></h3>



<p>Starting with what OnePlus Watch misses on, it skips Googleâs Wear OS platform. Though the custom skin isn&#8217;t any bad, but it will probably be a bummer for many given the massive Android ecosystem. Next, the screen wakes doesn&#8217;t wake up often when you raise your, OnePlus needs to fix it with an update. Also there&#8217;s not tap to wake, you will have to use the power button.<br></p>



<p>It lacks support for third-party apps, and there&#8217;s no support for iOS. Personalisation options are limited, as of now there&#8217;s only 14 watch faces to choose from.&nbsp;</p>
