Despite the Covishield injection, hospital officials disclosed, nearly 10% of the employees tested positive for Covid. The infection rate was significantly higher in doctors and nurses than in other hospital staff, possibly due to higher exposure.When a genomic analysis of the swab samples of the infected healthcare workers was completed recently by Dr Rajesh Pandey and Dr Anurag Agarwal at the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), they found that 70% of the infections were caused by the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), a variant of concern that became the predominant cause of Covid cases in Delhi from March onwards. Before that, Alpha and Kappa variants of the virus were the dominant strains.Dr S K Sarin, director of ILBS, said the high rates of breakthrough infection caused by the Delta variant was a worrisome trend. “It shows that the variants can breach the antibodies generated by the vaccines and the vaccines currently being administered may not offer sufficient protection against new mutant strains,” warned Sarin. “There may be a need for strict double masking by healthcare workers despite vaccinations.”Sarin also mentioned that the clinical presentation of the Delta variant patients was more severe and the virus remained in the infected subjects for longer periods.Unvaccinated and single dose recipients had a higher risk of infection compared with those who had received both the doses, said Dr Pratibha Kale, associate professor, department of microbiology, ILBS. She added that fully vaccinated staff were better protected with higher humoral immune response.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/covid-19-delta-variant-may-breach-vaccine-shield/articleshow/83889378.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-627931,resizemode-4,msid-83889378/covid-delta-variant-may-breach-vaccine-shield.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/covid-19-delta-variant-may-breach-vaccine-shield/articleshow/83889378.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T12:37:08+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Shed vaccine hesitancy: PM on Mann ki Baat</title><description>Cautioning people that the threat of COVID-19 remains, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged them to shed vaccine hesitancy and get themselves inoculated soon.In his monthly Mann ki Baat broadcast, Modi sought to tackle vaccine hesitancy, which has been seen in a section of the population, and spoke to some residents of Dulariya village, a tribal area in Betul district of Madhya Pradesh, as they shared fears and doubts being spread about the jabs.The prime minister noted that both he and his nearly 100-year-old mother have taken both doses of the vaccine and asked people to trust science and scientists, and to work to dispel rumours.If someone says corona is gone, do not be under this mistaken notion, Modi said, adding that the virus ailment is a "master of disguise" which surfaces in myriad new forms, a reference to its mutants."And to protect ourselves from it, we have two ways. One is adhering to the protocol for corona; wearing a mask, frequently washing hands with soap, maintaining social distancing. The other way is, along with all this, getting vaccinated. This too is a good safety shield," he said.Modi hailed the feat of administering over 86 lakh vaccine doses in a single day on June 21 at the start of the new phase of inoculation under which all adults are being given free jabs by the Union government.Over 31 crore people have got themselves vaccinated so far, he noted.With the National Doctors Day falling on July 1, Modi lauded the contribution of doctors in the corona period and said the day has become all the more special this time.He also paid tributes to Guru Prasad Mohapatra, secretary in his government who died due to Covid recently, saying that the officer worked overtime to make arrangements to ramp up oxygen production and supply during the recent wave even as he was battling the disease himself."Corona has snatched him away from us. There are countless people who have never been discussed. Our tribute to every such person would be that we follow the Covid protocol fully, get our vaccinations done," Modi said.With the Monsoon season gathering pace, the prime minister also stressed on water conservation and likened it to serving the nation.In this context, he mentioned Satchidanand Bharti of Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, a teacher whose hard work, Modi added, in conserving water has ended the water crisis in Ufrainkhal area of ?the district.In his broadcast, he also paid tributes and remembered the contribution of Indian sprint legend Milkha Singh, who died earlier this month.Modi hailed Singh's contribution to Indian sports and said he will always cherish his interactions with the athlete.Singh died in a Chandigarh hospital after a month-long battle with COVID-19. He also lost his wife Nirmal Kaur, a former national volleyball captain, to the same disease.Modi also shared the struggles and triumphs of Olympics-bound Indian athletes and said that people must not build any pressure on these sportspersons but "cheer for India"."Every athlete who is going to Tokyo has worked hard. They are going there to win hearts. It must be our endeavour to support our team and not put pressure on them," he said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/shed-vaccine-hesitancy-do-not-believe-in-rumours-pm-modi-to-people/articleshow/83889007.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-408425,resizemode-4,msid-83889007/shed-vaccine-hesitancy-pm-on-mann-ki-baat.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/shed-vaccine-hesitancy-do-not-believe-in-rumours-pm-modi-to-people/articleshow/83889007.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T12:06:42+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Unified military commands could be a reality soon</title><description>The government is determined to push ahead with joint military commands to build an integrated war-fighting machinery in a more cost-effective manner, even as efforts are under way to allay apprehensions of the Indian Air Force.The plan, as it stands now, is to formally announce the decision to create four new integrated commands on Independence Day this year. The integrated maritime theatre command (IMTC), integrated air defence command (IADC) and two integrated land theatre commands (for the borders with Pakistan and China) will then be "raised and operationalised" over a two-year period by August 15, 2023, top sources told on Saturday."A separate command for Jammu &amp; Kashmir, which will include counter-terrorism operations, is also under consideration. The final modalities are being worked out. The government fully backs the creation of the integrated commands," said a source.As per the plan being spearheaded by chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat, the "commencement of the raising" of the new commands will begin after August 15 this year. These "raisings" will be overseen by serving commanders-in-chief (senior Lt-Generals, Vice Admirals and Air Marshals), in addition to their existing responsibilities.With the raisings to be completed by August 15 next year, the "commencement of operationalisation" of the new commands will then follow with the appointments of the actual theatre commanders."The operationalisation will be completed by August 15, 2023. The theatre commanders will report directly to the chiefs of staff committee (CoSC), which is chaired by the CDS and includes the Army, Navy and IAF chiefs," he added.India currently has only two unified commands, the Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command to handle the country's nuclear arsenal, which were set up in 2001 and 2003 after the Kargil conflict with Pakistan.With India having as many as 17 single-service commands (Army 7, IAF 7 and Navy 3), which have little synergy in planning and operations as well as disjointed command-and-control structures, the need for joint commands and an integrated land-sea-air war-fighting machinery has been felt for a long time.The IAF, however, has resisted the move, stressing it would be operationally unwise to divide the country's "limited air assets" (just 30 fighter squadrons, six mid-air refuellers, three AWACS, two AEW&amp;C aircraft etc) among different theatre commands. Moreover, the IAF contends that it can swiftly move its forces from one front to another across the country in less than 48 hours.A high-level committee chaired by the CDS, and including the vice-chiefs of Army, Navy and IAF, chief of integrated defence staff and representatives from defence, home and finance ministries, has already met in a bid to resolve such internal differences within the armed forces as well as consult external stakeholders."Theatre commands will become a reality, one way or the other. They will be based fundamentally on a particular domain, with the assets and tri-service integration required in that domain. The CoSC will decide on the reallocation of forces among different theatres as and when required, depending on the contingency," said a senior officer."These turf wars cannot continue forever. Even in the US, the Goldwater-Nichols Act had to be ultimately thrust down the military's throat to streamline integration and the chain of command, which was being stymied by inter-Service rivalry," he added.The commander-in-chief of the proposed IMTC, for instance, will have full operational control over the Western and Eastern Naval Fleets, maritime strike fighter jets of IAF, two amphibious infantry brigades of the Army and Coast Guard for integrated planning and execution of operations, as reported by TOI earlier.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/unified-military-commands-could-be-a-reality-by-independence-day/articleshow/83888159.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-359331,resizemode-4,msid-83888159/unified-military-commands-could-be-a-reality-soon.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/unified-military-commands-could-be-a-reality-by-independence-day/articleshow/83888159.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T10:58:08+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Dec deadline for front seat airbags in existing cars</title><description>The road transport ministry has deferred the mandatory installation of airbags for front seat passengers in the existing car models by four months. Now the car manufacturers will have to comply with the norms from December 31. However, this mandatory condition for new models of cars, which have been rolled out this year, has kicked in from April 1.Sources said the relaxation has been made considering the pandemic situation since the manufacturers need to make some changes in their production line.In another move, the ministry has also allowed to increase the height of heavy goods carrying vehicles to 4.75 meters only for transporting “indivisible load”, which will come as a big relief for transport of steel and glass.However, S P Singh, senior fellow of IFTRT, a Delhi-based think tank on transport issues said, “The definition of indivisible load is very vague and this provision can be misused by transporters. On the one hand we are talking about reducing road deaths and on the other we are taking steps which have the potential to compromise road safety.”</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/govt-extends-deadline-for-mandatory-airbags-for-front-seat-passengers-in-existing-car-models-to-december/articleshow/83887721.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-37138,resizemode-4,msid-83887721/dec-deadline-for-front-seat-airbags-in-existing-cars.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/govt-extends-deadline-for-mandatory-airbags-for-front-seat-passengers-in-existing-car-models-to-december/articleshow/83887721.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T10:17:16+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Enid Blyton and the art of escapism through food</title><description>English heritage authorities have declared Enid Blyton guilty of racism and xenophobia, which has got her defenders protesting. Another charge might be encouraging childhood obesity. All her books seem packed with luscious descriptions of high-calorie feasts, replete with cakes, scones, sandwiches, processed meats and “lashings of ginger-beer”.There is even a children’s cookbook, Allegra McEvedy’s 'Jolly Good Food', which takes us from breakfasts with The Naughtiest Girl in School (porridge, scrambled eggs), snacks with the Secret Seven (jam tarts, rock buns), picnics with the Famous Five (chicken salad), tea up the Faraway Tree (macaroons, pop cakes), suppers on The Secret Island (grilled trout, potato salad) and midnight feasts at Mallory Towers (sausages, hot chocolate). Indian readers often seem able to overlook Blyton’s problematic views, but get aggrieved about missing the food.Novelist Manil Suri longed for Blyton’s foods, particularly “the tongue sandwiches that no hamper seemed to be complete without”. When he asked his mother, she was horrified: “We’re Indian... we don’t eat tongue.” And since no one they knew had an oven, they couldn’t make cakes and scones either.  83887621This was partly bad timing. Dishes of that kind were made in India during the British Raj thanks to khansamas who were trained to work even with the minimal equipment available then, like metal boxes that served as ovens when placed on burning coals and with more coals shovelled on top. And (buffalo) tongue definitely is eaten in India and, in fact, is ideally made in the one device Suri’s family did have at their disposal: The pressure cooker, whose intense steamy heat can cook the tough muscle into melting tenderness.But Blyton’s food was also largely a fantasy when she wrote about it in Britain. She started writing in the 1920s with fairy tales and retellings of myths, but only after 1938-39 did she start the adventure, mystery and school stories she is best known for today.This coincided with the start of World War II, which influences her work in subtle ways.  83887604It is why there are so many spies and secret weapons, but also why so many of her books are about children discovering the countryside. When the war started, children were evacuated out of cities, and she wanted to help her readers make the best of their wartime countryside homes. She avoided direct mention of the war though, unlike writers like Richmal Crompton, whose William stories from the time have the war as backdrop.Blyton’s daughter later explained that “the whole ambience of the books was to remind children of what life had been like and to assure them that those times would come back again”. And so, while food in wartime Britain was strictly rationed, with sugar and butter very hard to get, Blyton served up a fantasy of food in plenty. Her books were deliberately designed for escapism, and it is why children still use them to escape, no matter when or where they read them, or what they actually have to eat.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/enid-blyton-and-the-art-of-escapism-through-food/articleshow/83887165.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-421329,resizemode-4,msid-83887165/enid-blyton-and-the-art-of-escapism-through-food.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/enid-blyton-and-the-art-of-escapism-through-food/articleshow/83887165.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T09:32:40+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>How WFH has made cafés out of living rooms</title><description>Seeing colleagues walk into the office, portable coffee cups in one hand, or a quick catch-up session with friends at the neighbourhood cafe, is a thing of, well, 2019. Now, it’s a wake up and smell the coffee kind of situation for many of us, as we’re becoming our own baristas at home.Several coffee beans and equipment brands have reported an uptick in sales due to the lockdowns in place, and that has even prompted the launch of several new brands, who are keen to get on to the coffee bandwagon.Abhinav Mathur, CEO of Something’s Brewing, says they are processing more than 300 orders a month, from beans to equipment. “Home brewing has become a passion.This is a time when consumers are willing to experiment and learn new skills at home,” says Mathur.On The MenuEven tea drinkers are getting on board. “My husband and I invested in a French press to upgrade our coffee experience,” says Tanvi Johri, founder, Carmesi, who is also trying out different flavours of coffee. “Right now, I am experimenting with hazelnut flavourings. I enjoy coffee meetings on Zoom with my peers and colleagues. With the rains, resisting coffee has become even more difficult,” Johri says.    83887668Given how easy it is to make coffee at home, the trend is here to stay, feel brands. “The work from home culture has introduced a larger section of the population to preparing a fresh cup of coffee at home. This convenience makes it a part of many professionals’ lives,” says Rahul Aggarwal of Coffeeza.Caffeinated MeetingsFor Sudeep Singh, founder of MPowered, being “seriously deprived of a good cup of coffee” during the lockdown prompted him to pick up an espresso machine. “[At home] I tend to take my brew one or two times more than what I used to while at the office,” he says.“Our Monday morning Zoom meetings with the team are now termed ‘The Coffee Catch-up’, where we discuss strategy and plan work for the whole week ahead. Sometimes, we also indulge in virtual games and team bonding activities to break the monotony.”For Akshay Daftary, director, SIRO Clinpharm, it’s not just the coffee itself, but also the entire process of making a cuppa which has become a ritual to look forward to. “The process helps me ideate. Usually, I prefer the pod and bean machines because it lets me experiment,” he says.And it’s Insta-friendly too. “Customers are experimenting and creating their own versions. Vietnamese Cold Brew is one of the most popular recipes on social media,” Ajai Thandi, co-founder, Sleepy Owl Coffee, says.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/wfh-has-made-cafs-out-of-living-rooms-with-coffee-being-the-new-perk/articleshow/83887047.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-504284,resizemode-4,msid-83887047/how-wfh-has-made-cafs-out-of-living-rooms.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/wfh-has-made-cafs-out-of-living-rooms-with-coffee-being-the-new-perk/articleshow/83887047.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T09:22:03+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Two-child cap and other disincentives should go</title><description>The BJP administrator of the Lakshadweep Islands has created a furore through proposals such as prohibiting anybody with over two children from contesting local elections. Similar prohibitions exist in Assam, Odisha, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. This is silly. India and the world face not excessive but insufficient births.China once enforced a single child policy, later allowed two children, and now encourages three. Its working age population is falling so it desperately needs more workers to boost GDP. For a stable population, the total fertility rate — children born per woman — should be 2.1. This will not immediately stop population growth: future mothers have already been born. So, population typically rises for two decades after reaching 2.1 and then flattens.India’s fertility is plummeting. It must abandon bogus fears of excess population and prepare for a future with fewer and fewer people of working age (15 to 65 years old) and skyrocketing aged dependents. Improved medicine is raising life expectancy towards 90 years. New techniques keep prolonging life but at a high, rising cost. Societies need far more workers to finance care for the aged. Hence many countries have introduced incentives for more children. Alas, none has worked well. The cost of good child upbringing has shot up, so couples cannot afford even two children. Many countries are proposing free childcare, longer maternity and paternity leave, free child healthcare and other such incentives. Yet their fertility keeps falling.The rate is lowest in Taiwan (1.07), South Korea 1.09) and Singapore (1.15). It is well below replacement level in rich countries — Japan (1.38), Germany (1.48), the US (1.84) and UK (1.86). Rates are still above 3 in many African countries. But in Mexico, a traditional migrant supplier, fertility is down to 2.14. The long US tradition of immigration — despite Trump — has so far prevented population from falling as in Germany, Russia or Japan. Yet the latest data shows that the US population grew only 0.35% in 2019-20, almost the slowest ever.India’s fertility rate has fallen from 3.4 children in 1992-93 to 2.2 today, and is projected to fall to 1.93 by 2025. This is not because of penalties like bans on standing for elections. It is because an aspirational middle class wants fewer children.Far from having excess population, India is heading for the global trap of insufficient fertility rates, insufficient people of working age, and a huge excess of aged people needing costly medical care. Why then do so many BJP and RSS leaders (notably Mohan Bhagwat) worry about excess population? Mainly because of their paranoid belief that Muslims avoid birth control so the Muslim share of the population will rise and create Muslim-majority regions, threatening Hindu supremacy. A BJP leader is reported to have said the Hindu policy of “hum do hamare do” (we are two and have two children) has been converted by Muslims into “hum panch hamare pachees” (we are five and will have 25). The BJP stokes fears of Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh, whom Amit Shah has called “termites”.Muslim population growth has long exceeded Hindu growth, but religious conversion has been a negligible factor. A major reason is traditional Hindu prohibition of widow remarriage. Second, many Hindus are migrant labourers, spending months away from their home. Third, Muslims are on average poorer than Hindus, and poor people have more children. Fourth, some of their religious leaders oppose birth control, even though most Muslim countries now encourage family planning. Selective abortion of female fetuses (detected by sonograms) is common among Hindus but forbidden by Islam.The Muslim share of India’s population is up from 10% in 1951 to 14.2% in 2011, a slow growth over 75 years. But Muslim fertility is falling fast with rising incomes. It was just 1.4 in Jammu and Kashmir in 2016. India’s Muslim population share will rise slowly for some decades before stabilising, probably well below 20%. This carries no threat to Hindu dominance. Bangladesh’s fertility rate is down to 2, below replacement level. Its per capita income now rivals India’s. The economic rationale for migrating to India is gone.What lessons flow for India? Abolish all disincentives for large families including bans on standing for local elections and penalties in entry and promotions in government services. Abolish rules reducing benefits for families with more than two children, including healthcare for mothers and children and nutritional supplements for pregnant women. Legislate male parental leave to make it easier for mothers to work. Upgrade anganwadis to proper pre-schools where feasible. Increase security for women and cut other barriers to female work participation, which is among the lowest in the world. Breed more workers and ensure work for them. </description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/view-two-child-cap-and-other-disincentives-should-go-we-need-more-babies-not-less/articleshow/83888167.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-482417,resizemode-4,msid-83888167/two-child-cap-and-other-disincentives-should-go.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/view-two-child-cap-and-other-disincentives-should-go-we-need-more-babies-not-less/articleshow/83888167.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T11:04:53+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>View: No mixgivings about those mixtapes</title><description>The late 1990s was a time for romance. The smallest thing you could do for a girl was to give her flowers and chocolates. If you had the brains, you’d write her a poem. If you didn’t, you’d go to a card shop, copy one down and give it to her. But by far the most romantic thing you could do was to give her a mixtape. Let me explain.You see, millennials, once there was a thing called an audio cassette. It was used for storing and playing music — on a ribbon-like tape. And giving a girl a mixtape — a compilation of songs one recorded on a tape — was the greatest show of commitment. Not the drag-23-mp3s-into-a-device stuff of today. You had to find out all the songs that she loved — or thought she loved. Then you had to call your friends to find out which of them had audiotapes with those songs.Calling your friends wasn’t easy either. Remember, there were no mobile phones, but dial-ups. And if you came from a middle-class family, your mother put a lock on the phone. Not a passcode, but an actual padlock. So, you had to wait until you hung out with your friends — physically, as there was no WhatsApp — to ask them for the songs. But when you asked them for those songs, you lost your self-respect. Imagine an 18-year-old dude going to his friends and saying, ‘Hey, um, do you have ‘Nothing’s Going to Change My Love for You’?’ The irony was that each of them had that those cheesy songs, but would be damned before admitting to it.Essentially, it meant getting hold of 15 different tapes that had these songs, which we had to fast forward or rewind, pause, play, stop… repeat procedure with another cassette for another song. If things were still exploratory, you would get her a 60-minute tape. If serious, a 90-minute one.In the 90s, the object known as a ‘pencil’ still existed. It was mainly used for an activity called ‘writing’. But if the tape-recorder’s fast-forward or rewind button was wonky, one would take this pencil thing, stick it in one of the two grooves on the cassette, twirl it around, thereby manually rewinding or fast-forwarding the tape’s ribbon.For the purpose of recording songs, we had devices called two-in-ones. You’d put the tape that had the song in one deck. In the other one, you’d put the blank tape on which you wanted the song recorded. One side had a play button and the other had a play and record button. You had to press them both with military precision.The upside of it all — the recipient of the mixtape would not only get a peek into (what she believed to be) your taste in music, but also a confirmation that your eye-hand coordination was reliable, and you weren’t the fumbly kind. At the risk of coming across as an Uncle-ji, today, things are mighty different. Today, you could be at the most boring party ever, but five people will get together, click a pic, stick it up on Insta and write, ‘Oh my god… last night was EPIC!’ Oops, I meant, ‘OMG…. last night was EPIC!’I don’t understand the use of the word ‘epic’ here, no matter how much capitalised. The Ramayan is an epic. The Iliad is an epic. You getting drunk and passing out on a sofa can’t be the same literary genre, can it?I’m an analog man living in a digital world and hardly qualified to give relationship advice. Especially to a generation that is more creative, intelligent, savvy and worldly-wise than we ever were. But one thing I know for sure — the greatest gift you can give anyone is your time. In the form of 60-minute mixtape if you’re still iffy. A 90-minute one if you’re serious. I just checked. A TDK 90-minute audio cassette costs ₹1,290 online. Hell, I don’t think I’m ready for a relationship yet.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-no-mixgivings-about-those-mixtapes/articleshow/83878296.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-284215,resizemode-4,msid-83878296/view-no-mixgivings-about-those-mixtapes.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-no-mixgivings-about-those-mixtapes/articleshow/83878296.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T23:32:50+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>States concerned about proposed e-comm rules</title><description>Some states, mostly those ruled by non-BJP parties, are apprehensive about the new set of e-commerce rules proposed by the Union Consumer Affairs Ministry to check mis-selling and fraudulent discounts, as they fear there could be a negative impact on jobs and market access for MSMEs created by various digital platforms in recent years. These state governments plan to suggest strong safeguard measures in the proposed rules to ensure that any changes in the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 do not hamper their economic growth engines and revenue collections, officials from those states said. However, it would be kept in mind that their suggestions do not come in way of the proposed rules enhancing the overall consumer protection framework, they asserted. Declining to be identified, these officials said it is a sensitive matter that needs to be tackled carefully as protecting consumers' interest is as important as safeguarding jobs, MSMEs and lakhs of self-employed individuals including artisans, weavers and those in agriculture and allied sectors who have been benefiting immensely from the growth of the e-commerce sector. The officials said formal suggestions on the draft rules would be made to the Centre, which has invited suggestions till July 6, would be made after deliberating all the issues and after consulting all stakeholders. A large number of foreign and domestic investors and other business entities, who have either invested in various e-commerce platforms or are doing business with them, are also said to be wary of certain proposed rules, including on 'fall-back liability', flash sales, or deep discounting and data sharing. Their apprehensions include greater liabilities for online retailers for goods and services sold on their platforms, which could also impact the ability of e-commerce players to raise funds going forward and may prompt existing and prospective investors to put in place additional measures to safeguard their returns. Major e-commerce players such as Amazon and Walmart/Flipkart, as also some industry bodies, are also likely to submit their views on these proposals soon. A senior official of a big non-BJP-ruled state said there is a view that the proposed rules can disturb the state's business ecosystem, especially with regard to MSMEs and small entrepreneurs and will also limit the choices for consumers, rather than safeguarding their interest. He pointed out that MSMEs contribute almost two-thirds of the annual revenues generated on just two major platforms -- Amazon and Flipkart -- and that itself runs into thousands of crores of rupees, while there is a big chain involved comprising of businesses, self-employed individuals, warehouses, farmers etc and these platforms have created lakhs of jobs in the recent years. Among various measures, the draft amendments propose banning of fraudulent flash sales and mis-selling of goods and services on e-commerce platforms. Ban on misleading users by manipulating search results, and appointment of chief compliance officer and resident grievance officer are some of the other amendments being proposed. E-commerce entities are also required to provide information not later than 72 hours of the receipt of an order from a government agency for prevention, detection and investigation and prosecution of offences under any law, as per the proposed amendments. The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 were first notified in July last year. Their violations attract penal action under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. The government said that following the notification of the e-commerce rules, it has received several representations from aggrieved consumers, traders and associations "complaining against widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in the e-commerce ecosystem." Among the key amendments, the government has proposed a ban on mis-selling of goods and services offered on such platforms. Those engaging in 'cross-selling' will have to provide adequate disclosures to users displayed prominently. The government also seeks to ban 'flash sales' on e-commerce platforms "if such sales are organised by fraudulently intercepting the ordinary course of business using technological means with an intent to enable only a specified seller or group of sellers managed by such entity to sell goods or services on the platform." However, the ministry clarified, "Conventional e-commerce flash sales are not banned. Only specific flash sales or back-to-back sales which limit customer choice, increase prices and prevent a level playing field are not allowed." "... Certain e-commerce entities are engaging in limiting consumer choice by indulging in 'back to back' or 'flash' sales wherein one seller selling on a platform does not carry any inventory or order fulfillment capability but merely places a 'flash or back-to-back' order with another seller controlled by platform," it said. Such sales will not be allowed as this prevents a level playing field and ultimately limits customer choice and increases prices, the ministry added.The proposed amendment defines 'flash sale' as that organised by an e-commerce entity at significantly reduced prices, high discounts or any other such promotional offers for a predetermined period of time. The government has also proposed 'fall-back liability' for every marketplace e-commerce entity to ensure that consumers are not adversely affected in the event where a seller fails to deliver goods or services due to negligent conduct by such seller.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/some-states-concerned-about-proposed-e-commerce-rules-fear-negative-impact-on-jobs-msmes/articleshow/83887900.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-449089,resizemode-4,msid-83887900/states-concerned-about-proposed-e-comm-rules.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/some-states-concerned-about-proposed-e-commerce-rules-fear-negative-impact-on-jobs-msmes/articleshow/83887900.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T10:32:35+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Infra projects show cost overruns in crores</title><description>As many as 478 infrastructure projects, each worth Rs 150 crore or more, have been hit by cost overruns totalling more than Rs 4.4 lakh crore, according to a report.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation monitors infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above.  Of the 1,768 such projects, 478 reported cost overruns and 525 were delayed.  "Total original cost of implementation of the 1,768 projects was Rs 22,86,955.18 crore and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 27,27,220.47 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of Rs 4,40,265.29 crore (19.25 per cent of original cost)," the ministry's latest report for May 2021 said.  According to the report, the expenditure incurred on these projects till May 2021 is Rs 13,30,533.53 crore, which is 48.79 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.  However, the report said that the number of delayed projects decreases to 387 if delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion.  Further, for 995 projects neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.  Out of 525 delayed projects, 100 projects have an overall delay in the range of 1-12 months, 124 projects (13-24 months), 182 projects (25-60 months) and 119 projects (61 months and above).  The average time overrun in these 525 delayed projects is 46.36 months.  Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.  Delay in tie-up for project financing, delay in finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, delay in tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems, among others, are the other reasons, the report said.  The report also cited 'state-wise lockdown due to COVID-19' as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.  It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are underreported, it added.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/478-infra-projects-show-cost-overruns-worth-rs-4-4-lakh-crore/articleshow/83888048.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-99305,resizemode-4,msid-83888048/infra-projects-show-cost-overruns-in-crores.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/infrastructure/478-infra-projects-show-cost-overruns-worth-rs-4-4-lakh-crore/articleshow/83888048.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T10:46:58+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>How India fed the world during the pandemic</title><description>The year 2020-21 is a top contender for being one of the worst periods in India’s history. But export numbers for 2020-21 show that it could well be the year India fed the world.Overall, exports have kept hopes up, even as the country’s domestic demand is suffering due to the pandemic. Since March, India’s exports have been on a positive trajectory. The numbers jumped over 60% year-on-year to $34.5 billion in March and clocked $30.63 billion in April, a gigantic growth of 195.72% YoY. In May, exports grew 67.4% to $32.2 billion against $19 billion in May 2020, a growth of 69.35%. The first week of June alone saw exports rising 52.4%, at $7.1 billion.The rebound signs indicate demand is picking up in the West, and the Indian economy has an opportunity to ride this wave. Small and medium industries could gain as categories such as engineering goods and gems and jewellery are seeing pent-up demand.But it is the significant jump in exports of corn, rice and wheat that stands out.According to a report by the Agricultural and Processed Foods Exports Development Authority (APEDA), 2020-21 rice exports (basmati and non-basmati) almost doubled to 17.7 million tonnes (mt) from the previous period, creating a record. Rice exports in 2019-20 were 9.5 mt and in 2018-19 were 12 mt. Similarly, wheat exports surged to 2.1 mt in 2020-21 compared with only 0.22 mt in the previous period, and 0.23 mt in 2018-19, a record 861% increase YoY. That was the highest since FY15.A low base effect is bound to show a spurt in exports this year, particularly as trade and commerce had come to halt last year. So to get a better picture, a comparison with 2018-19 has also been done.As the pandemic hit production globally, countries wanted to ensure they had enough food, and this led to the jump in exports, say experts.                  83767938“There was an increase in demand from the international market for rice and wheat. They wanted to take care of their food security,” M Angamuthu, Chairman, APEDA, tells ET Digital. “In many countries, production has also been affected. Since we had good agricultural production, India could fulfil the rising export demand.”The RBI had last year stated that India had a foodgrain surplus and the main challenge was managing this bounty. Total foodgrain production reached a whooping 296.65 mt in 2019-20, a 4% increase from 2018-19. At the same time, horticulture production, which holds a 40% share of gross value added (GVA) in the farm sector, also reached an all-time high of 320.48 mt, 3.13% higher than the previous year.Apart from the surplus grain production, a boom in commodity prices also fuelled the exports. Taranjeet Singh Bhamra, CEO, AgNext Technologies, says rice and wheat are being traded at competitive prices in the international markets. “For instance, Indian wheat is available at $280-$285 per tonne, against Australia’s $298, EU’s $304, USA’s $323 and Canada’s $339 per tonne.” Moreover, India's bumper harvest and the presence of a large surplus even after government procurement ensured that the authorities did not impose any export restriction, he adds.Explaining how other factors also helped, Angamuthu points out that the government’s Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, launched to provide foodgrain to the poor during the pandemic. Huge quantities of foodgrain were offered for free under the scheme. The massive distribution suppressed the demand for rice and wheat in the domestic market. This led to prices falling in the domestic market, while ensuring large quantities were available for export.                  83767991Since May 2014, the Food and Agricultural Organization’s Food Price Index - which measures the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities - has been at its highest, and the price of wheat and rice in many major exporting countries continue to remain higher than in India. Both Angamuthu and Bhamra say they expect this trend to continue this financial year as well. “I expect consistent growth in production and exports, in part due to a favorable monsoon forecast by the India Meteorological Department, and in part due to the rise in FAO’s Food Price Index,” Bhamra says.Another foodgrain that saw its highest exports since 2013 was corn, which also saw a dip in global production and a surplus in the domestic market. According to a Reuters report, Indian corn is being quoted at $295-$300 a tonne, including cost and freight. Meanwhile, South American corn is being quoted at $330 a tonne, C&amp;F. Besides, Indian exporters are preparing to sell around 400,000 tonnes of corn in June-July to animal feed producers in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.Tailwind for other goodsThis April also saw a sudden surge in sectors such as engineering goods and gems and jewellery. The reason behind this being the low base effect kicking in February.According to a report by the Engineering Exports Promotion Council of India (EEPC India), exports of 32 of 33 engineering goods commodities such as steel, iron, non-ferrous metal products and industrial machinery witnessed a positive growth in March 2021. The report stated that exports to 21 of 25 top markets saw a rise in shipments from India during this period. A year-on-year jump was seen in nine key countries in February. Industry machinery that saw a boost in exports included boilers (64.49%), pumps and valves (61.72%), internal combustion engines and parts (51.94%) and industrial machinery for dairy (57.22%), among others, in March 2021 compared with last year.                    83768008Overall, India’s engineering exports were valued at $8.7 billion in March 2021 and $5.3 billion in March 2020. This number was at $9.2 billion in March 2019. EEPC reported that the 42% decline in March 2020 was due to the pandemic biting the global economy and lockdowns beginning that month around the world. February 2020’s number had reported a YoY increase of 3.5% at $6.7 billion.The demand for gems and jewellery has also returned. In April 2021, shipments in this segment reached Rs 22,226.11 crore year-on-year, according to a report by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC). While the sector declined by 25.71% in 2020-21, it saw a demand pickup after November. A significant growth of 12.73% was seen in the January-March quarter.“Last year, from November onwards, once things started getting better, demand came back pretty strong,” says GJEPC Chairman Colin Shah. “There was a lot of pent-up demand because of the lockdown. Once things opened up, people went shopping.”The exports of gems &amp; jewellery in March 2021 stood at $3.4 billion, a jump of 78.22% from last year ($1.9 billion) and $2.9 billion in May 2021, recording a growth of 179.32% from last year ($1 billion). The numbers stood at $3 billion in March 2019 and $3.7 billion in May 2019. The exports will reach pre-pandemic level soon and will get stronger by Diwali, he asserts.This favourable growth in exports, albeit supported by the base effect, indicates better supply response towards demand from key markets. Imports in May, too, grew 68.54% to $38.53 billion. Owing to the enhanced exports, the trade deficit in May plummeted to $6.32 billion from $15.1 billion in April. The numbers have raised hopes of helping India meet its export targets.Last month, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan had confidently said that the second wave of Covid had not impacted the exports trajectory and India’s external trade would continue with its encouraging performance.However, many issues continue to hinder export growth, the latest one being Covid restrictions such as travel bans and state lockdowns. This has hurt manufacturing. GJEPC’s Shah says it is extremely important that manufacturing resumes to the full extent soon.                  83768027It is the travel ban to certain countries, especially to those in the Middle East, which has perturbed Ashish Pethe, Chairman, All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council. “The travel ban will surely worsen the situation, as buyers will start looking for alternative sources in South Asian or Southeastern countries. Do not forget, China has always been our biggest competitor in exports.”The gems and jewellery industry contributes 6-7% to our GDP. In 2019-20, its exports contributed $35.81 billion, he says. The chairman of the domestic council emphasises on the need to grow exports in the sector. “Handmade Indian jewellery has a higher percentage of value addition. If concerted efforts are put in to grow exports to $50 billion, it will have a cascading effect on the domestic industry too. This will help the nation reach its $1 trillion export target,” he adds. APEDA’S Angamuthu says agricultural exports too need a boost. It can help achieve the Prime Minister’s vision of doubling farmers’ income. The sector contributes 12-13% to India’s exports. But for that to happen, certain bottlenecks should be removed.Bhamra of AgNext Technologies says the immediate issue is the pandemic. “Some concerns remain due to increasing penetration of Covid in rural populations. It increases the possibility of production and trade being hit,” he points out.In the longer term, proper food storage facilities and reliable food quality assessment solutions will play a major role in increasing agri exports. Over the years, food import rules across the world have become stringent in terms of quality. There is also increasing emphasis on traceability of food products to the farm level to ensure adherence to production norms.“India lacks adequate infrastructure to support these requirements consistently. We need better and highly scalable post-harvest management &amp; food storage solutions to ensure quality and shelf life of agri-commodities are maintained. Better warehousing solutions, cold storage facilities for transport and rapid food quality assessment solutions are critical to scale India’s agri-exports,” Bamra adds.(Editing by Ram Mohan.

By March-end the following year, the shares fell to as low as Rs 13.35. On June 22 this year, when the bankruptcy court approved a resolution plan to take Jet Airways out of bankruptcy, they closed at Rs 99.45.The offer from UK-based investor Kalrock Capital and Gulf businessman Murari Lal Jalan to take over Jet Airways will bring the ownership of more than 152,000 retail shareholders to 0.21% from 25%. Many of these small shareholders still traded in the shares, though there was little for them in the deal.Retail shareholders are often at the losing end of bankruptcy resolutions at companies. Among other recent examples, hundreds of thousands of retail shareholders in Videocon Industries and Value Industries, and Dewan Housing Finance will get nothing from the resolution plans approved for these companies. In Ruchi Soya Industries, their holding will fall to 1.13% from 84.47%.    83878984Experts feel there should be some mechanism to ensure that the retail shareholders don’t lose their money, or at least they were able to make a more informed decision while trading in companies that are going through the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP).Under the ‘waterfall mechanism’ of the Insolvency &amp; Bankruptcy Code (IBC), equity shareholders come last on the priority list for receiving any proceeds in a resolution plan. Since most resolution plans are approved with massive losses to the creditors, shareholders are unlikely to get anything, whether a company remains listed or delisted, during sharing of the proceeds. But retail shareholders often continue to trade in such shares because of lack of information on the proceedings.“The moment companies are admitted for insolvency resolution, it becomes a black box. So now the question is, should such black box companies be allowed to trade,” said JN Gupta, managing director of proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services.    83878989“Every regulation of Sebi calls for transparency, but the moment a company is admitted under the CIRP, transparency goes away…,” said Gupta, who is also a former executive director at market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India. “All the stakeholders have the right to know what is the liquidation valuation or who all are bidders for the company.”According to data compiled by Capitalline Database, 90 listed companies that have been admitted for the CIRP process have more than 5.7 million retail investors, with Rs 21,931 crore of exposure.“A committee should be set up to consider the pros and cons of imposing a moratorium on trading in the stock of a listed company, just like it happens in other aspects when the company is admitted under the corporate insolvency resolution process,” said Jyoti A Singh, founder of AJA Legal &amp; Associates.“Several small, vulnerable investors from Tier 2 and 3 cities often get exposed to such companies and end up trading in scrip. Therefore, there should be at least a mechanism that gives alert to a person who wishes to trade in the scrip of the company that is undergoing CIRP,” added Singh.In November 2017, Sajjan Jindal, chairman of the JSW Group, also expressed similar views about suspension of trading in companies facing insolvency resolution, as is the global practice, to avoid speculation in the market.“Suspension of shares helps in cleaner takeovers and doesn't make the deal expensive for the prospective investor,” said Jindal in a tweet on November 2, 2017, whose group has acquired companies such as Bhushan Power &amp; Steel, Monnet Ispat and Asian Colour Coated Ispat through the IBC process. “Investor must have the flexibility for automatic de-listing of the company as the equity value is not there in most NCLT cases,” he had tweeted.However, some retail shareholder protection groups believe that a complete suspension of trading could also be counterproductive since that would close the only exit route for such equity holders.Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services, said: “When a company is going through a bankruptcy process, one should expect the existing share capital and shareholders to be wiped out. However, until the bankruptcy process is completed, trading in the company's stock facilitates an exit process for shareholders.”Since the inception of IBC, 4,376 insolvency resolution processes had commenced till the end of March 2021, including 2,653 that had since been closed. As many as 348 had ended in approval of the resolution plan and the 1,277 in orders for liquidation. The rest were in various stages of the process, as per the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board’s quarterly report in March.“Several retail shareholders, often with limited information about CIRP, put their money into such companies, which usually results in the complete erosion of their investments,” said Paras Savla, an insolvency resolution professional and partner at advisory firm KPB &amp; Associates.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jury-is-still-out-on-whether-bankrupt-companies-be-allowed-to-trade-on-bourses/articleshow/83875278.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-134221,resizemode-4,msid-83875278/should-bankrupt-cos-be-allowed-to-trade-on-bourses.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/jury-is-still-out-on-whether-bankrupt-companies-be-allowed-to-trade-on-bourses/articleshow/83875278.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T09:15:17+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>InterGlobe gets shareholders' nod to raise Rs 3K cr</title><description>NEW DELHI: Shareholders of InterGlobe Aviation, parent of the country's largest airline IndiGo, have approved a proposal to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore.  The funds would be raised through the Qualified Institutional Placement route.  The remote e-voting on the proposal commenced on May 27 and ended on June 25. Shareholders of the company have cleared the proposal, it said in a regulatory filing on Saturday.  Amid the airline industry facing strong headwinds due to the coronavirus pandemic, the company's board, on May 10, gave its nod to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore through sale of shares to institutional investors.  On June 5, IndiGo reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 1,147.2 crore in the three months ended March, mainly due to a sharp decline in revenues amid the pandemic.  The airline, which had a fleet of 285 planes at the end of March 2021, had a net loss of Rs 870.8 crore in the year-ago period.  As air travel demand was significantly hit by the pandemic, the carrier's consolidated total income slumped over 26 per cent to Rs 6,361.8 crore in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal. The total income was at Rs 8,634.6 crore in the 2020 March quarter.  On June 7, IndiGo Chief Financial Officer Jiten Chopra said the daily cash burn increased to Rs 19 crore in the March quarter from Rs 15 crore in the earlier quarter and given the current situation, the cash burn is expected to increase further in the June quarter.  Emphasising that managing the cash position remains the primary focus, he had said, "we continue to work with all our stakeholders. For this purpose, we are working on securing credit line from lenders and entering into sale and lease back for the new aircraft".  These two actions will likely result in an additional liquidity of Rs 45 billion (Rs 4,500 crore) for the coming year, he had noted.  "Apart from this, we have also secured board approval for raising funds by way of qualified institutional placement up to Rs 30 billion rupees (Rs 3,000 crore) and this proposal is under consideration by the shareholders," he had said.  For the full year ended March 2021, the company's net loss widened to Rs 5,806.4 crore from Rs 233.7 crore in 2019-20 fiscal.  Total income fell 58 per cent to Rs 15,677.6 crore in the last financial year. The same stood at Rs 37,291.5 crore in the year-ago period.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/companies/interglobe-aviation-gets-shareholders-approval-to-raise-rs-3000-cr-via-qip/articleshow/83887328.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-88951,resizemode-4,msid-83887328/interglobe-gets-shareholders-nod-to-raise-rs-3k-cr.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/companies/interglobe-aviation-gets-shareholders-approval-to-raise-rs-3000-cr-via-qip/articleshow/83887328.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T09:43:21+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>View: The factor that propelled New Zealand's win</title><description>Sometimes, just sometimes, nice guys do finish first.These were the words Simon Doull, the former New Zealand fast bowler, used to capture the moment in which his erstwhile team won the final of the World Test Championship. The relief in his voice was obvious, as was the emotion, and you will not find too many people in the world of cricket who will challenge the assertion that Kane Williamson’s men are genuine good guys.The manner in which Williamson handled himself, with the team taking their cue from him, after they were declared second best in the 2019 50-over World Cup final, was proof positive that there was not one sore loser in that squad. For once, it was not only the winners who hogged the limelight.Equally, Williamson and his crew were all class in victory. There were no over-the-top celebrations, no putting down of the vanquished. Just a moment of joy in the warm embrace of success.But, to reduce New Zealand to clichés about good guys does not do them justice. Over the course of six rain-interrupted days, they showed how much they had grown as a team in the two years that spanned the World Test Championship.In Devon Conway and Tom Latham they had two openers who had grown up in seam- and swing-friendly conditions in New Zealand, and as result developed a technique that worked in Test cricket. Williamson and Ross Taylor, two giants from the New Zealand school of batting, oozed skill and composure, marrying experience with obvious talent and hard work. In Colin de Grandhomme and Kyle Jamieson they had two all-rounders to balance the playing 11, at a time when India cannot find one fit fast bowling all-rounder from a billion-plus population.Trent Boult and Tim Southee form an opening bowling pair that is more likely than any other in operation today to provide the early breakthrough. As for Neil Wagner, he can be enforcer or work horse, banging it in short with unerring accuracy or hammering away at a length and drying the runs up.The New Zealand team that played India in the final literally did not have one weak link. While it must be conceded that the conditions favoured their style of bowling, equal credit must be given to the think-tank for the manner in which they assessed the conditions and picked an 11 that would give them the best chance of succeeding.It is here that credit must be given to New Zealand. While it is charming that the least populous major cricketing nation punches above its weight routinely, Williamson and his team should not be reduced to a mere cliché. If anything, their success is proof that having unlimited resources is not the be all and end all in life. What you do with what you have counts for so much more.It is also worth remembering that New Zealand have had the smallest turnover of Test players in the period that built up to the World Test Championship final. What this tells you is that those that run the game in the country had a clear vision of which personnel would do the job and then persisted with them, allowing them to grow as individuals and into interlocking pieces where the sum of the parts was larger than the whole.The fact that they do not cuss and growl on the field does not make this New Zealand team any less fierce than the opposition they come up against. If anything, this is a template for other countries to follow, putting the actual skills of the game front and centre, and focusing on that to the exclusion of all else. At the end of the day, cricket is not about 11 individuals doing the best they can. It is a team game, and New Zealand epitomise this.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-the-new-zealand-team-that-played-india-in-the-final-literally-did-not-have-one-weak-link/articleshow/83872723.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-491165,resizemode-4,msid-83872723/view-the-factor-that-propelled-new-zealands-win.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-the-new-zealand-team-that-played-india-in-the-final-literally-did-not-have-one-weak-link/articleshow/83872723.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T22:49:38+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Watch out for watches that dazzled on rich wrists</title><description>Gustafsson &amp; Sjögren, the luxury watchmaker from Sweden, has sold three pieces that cost about ₹24 lakh each in India last month, says Raahul Kapoor, a Delhi-based seller.Even when the pandemic was sweeping across the country, people were in the queue for the limited-edition watches that now have an eight-month waiting period. The name may be unfamiliar to most, but aficionados are willing to bide time for this brand that is known for watches made of hand-forged Damascus steel and which depict scenes of Aurora Borealis and the Sarek national park of Lapland on their dials.Earlier this year, a Pune-based watch enthusiast picked up a Cecil Purnell through Kapoor, cofounder of Excedo Luxuria that retails and distributes luxury brands. The watch cost an eye-popping ₹3.4 crore.While the global scenario of watches is poor, Kapoor says the pandemic hasn't affected his Indian buyers. The super-wealthy, Kapoor says, continue to invest in what he calls "a partner legacy".“They know it's like buying jewellery or an art collection to own a piece of history,” he says.  83886669Meanwhile, brands like Cecil Purnell have been pulling out all the stops to woo customers — from hand-delivering watches to indulging them with expensive meals and sculptures to make sure the sale goes through.For the luxury segment of watches — below the super-luxury band — the pandemic year of 2020 has been a mixed bag. While their businesses suffered as retail stores stayed shut for nearly five months in India, the ultra-rich who were unable to travel abroad to buy their favourite products shopped here. The market bounced back to some extent for certain categories, say retailers.Industry observers say the segment that got pummelled was the middle-of-the-order category or what is called the bridge-to-luxury section. Statistical organisations in Switzerland — from where a majority of watches are imported into India — don’t often make the distinction between luxury, bridge-to-luxury and premium watches while collating numbers. According to IDC, the watches category witnessed 139% year-on-year growth with shipments of 2.6 million units in 2020.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/watch-out-for-watches-that-dazzled-on-rich-wrists/articleshow/83876185.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-709410,resizemode-4,msid-83876185/watch-out-for-watches-that-dazzled-on-rich-wrists.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/watch-out-for-watches-that-dazzled-on-rich-wrists/articleshow/83876185.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T22:04:41+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>The ghosts haunting India's bureaucracy</title><description>I’ve had it up to here with everyone blaming either incompetence or intrigue for the flailings and failings of Indian-administered India. People have been quibbling, since the first pen-pusher pushed his pen, over which is worse — being rubbish at one’s job, or conspiring to not do it properly (or at all) to satisfy higher-ups (and, therefore, one’s own brood). Well, this week we finally got to know what truly ails Indian bureaucracy: ghosts.The Gajra Raja Medical College (GRMC) in Gwalior may not be at the forefront of India’s battle against Covid-19. But its authorities finally lifted a white veil that has covered clerical India far longer than the 40 years since Rajkumar Kohli’s Jaani Dushman exposed another of India’s secrets: that at the root of feudalism and caste politics lies sex. A bunch of RTI applicants had been investigating certain ‘anomalies’ regarding MBBS admissions into the college. In September 2018, one RTI applicant had sought admission records for the 1994 batch. He suspected that very mysteriously, non-domiciles — those not from Madhya Pradesh, but from the mortal realm nonetheless — had somehow got MBBS admission through the domicile quota.After reportedly buffeting the RTI applicants’ requests by first stating that the records pertaining to the information sought had been seized by the shadowy CBI [strains of ‘Gumnaam hai koi/ Badnaam hai koi…’], the college authorities stated that the clerk responsible for the documents had been apprehended by the said shadowy CBI [ ‘Gumnaam hai koi/ Badnaam hai koi…’].Finally, the GRMC authorities, like cornered members of the gnostic Satanic group Our Lady of Endor, tumbled out with the truth: the room in which the sought-after documents lie is now haunted by the ghost of the aforementioned clerk, who had apparently committed suicide. So, unlocking that room would be, well, a nightmare.Remember, Madhya Pradesh, home to the Great Vyapam Scam — the state government’s entrance examination racket uncovered in 2013 involving politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen — is literally Middle India.If the disquiet spirit of one clerk in Gwalior is responsible for an information blackout, you can well imagine the spiritual dangers and harm posed in getting information, pushing a file, accessing records across the country.All this bhoot-pret business must sound all very gawaar to some of you cityslickers. But the country’s administration — governmental or otherwise — has now been found to be haunted. That explains the till-now inexplicable reason why not just authorities, but the flesh and blood citizenry in general, find it so odd for people to pursue information, despite the paranormal dangers this entails.Gattu Vamana Rao and his wife Nagamani in Telangana, for instance, are the latest in a long list of RTI activists harassed, attacked or killed for snooping around. The Raos were mysteriously ‘murdered by knife’ for filing an RTI on ‘land issues’. Killer ghosts, I conclude.Karl Marx was on to something when he wrote about a ‘spectre haunting Europe’, the birthplace of modern bureaucracy under Otto von Bismarck and the Junker elite of eastern Prussia. What is less known is that in the original German, Marx had written ‘gespenst’ — spook, ghoul — literally ghost, rather than the metaphorical spectre.It was this Victorian invention — used by the colonial British regime in India to collect, collate, use information and hide it from its subjects and rule — that continues to haunt India. After all, what is a ghost? It’s an entity which, after losing its original purpose, finds itself repurposed to haunt its old stomping grounds.Exorcists to cleanse the system? Don’t be silly. Regular yagnas to keep these spirits — they exist in a plane ‘higher up’ — untroubled is the wise thing to do, digital betaals be damned.Views are personal</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-the-ghosts-haunting-indias-bureaucracy/articleshow/83877444.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-277835,resizemode-4,msid-83877444/the-ghosts-haunting-indias-bureaucracy.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/opinion/et-commentary/view-the-ghosts-haunting-indias-bureaucracy/articleshow/83877444.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T22:55:05+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>At 36, Ronaldo dominates the world stage yet again</title><description>Portugal felt the full range of emotions during the Euro 2020 group stage and with Cristiano Ronaldo in the groove again, they can really begin to believe. After scoring three late goals to beat Hungary, Portugal were shaken by a 4-2 loss to Germany, only for a 2-2 draw against France to restore morale and ensure they snuck out of Group F in third place. The result is a last-16 clash with Belgium in Seville on Sunday, when one of the tournament favourites will bow out in what is surely the blockbuster tie of the round. One of the frontrunners for the Golden Boot will fall too, with Ronaldo and Belgium’s Romelu Lukaku both in contention. Ronaldo leads the scoring charts on five goals with Lukaku not far behind on three. Portugal may have taken only a point from a sweaty contest with France at the Puskas Arena in Budapest but the belief and confidence gained from going toe-to-toe with the world champions could be pivotal for the rest of their tournament. After chaos against Germany came concentration against the French, a committed, organised and aggressive performance which was a reminder of what carried Portugal to success at Euro 2016 and in the Nations League three years later. “We were strong and consistent. The players helped each other, we had possession, we attacked well. We improved a lot from the game against Germany,” said Portugal’s coach Fernando Santos afterwards. Santos had responded too, reacting to criticism by reverting to his traditional 4-3-3 system of the past two years and making some bold changes to his starting line-up. William Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes, who both struggled in the first two games, made way for the young Renato Sanches and the veteran Joao Moutinho, who both rose to the challenge against Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante. Sanches brought some much-needed dynamism to the team while the 34-year-old Moutinho’s surgical passing gave Portugal the guile and direction they had lacked against Germany. The principal threat against Belgium will be Ronaldo who, at 36, is sparkling again on the biggest stage, delivering goals and breaking records from the outset. Ronaldo had never previously scored in six meetings with France but his two penalties means he has already achieved his best Euro tally, after scoring twice in 2004, once in 2008 and three times in both 2012 and 2016. He has pulled five clear of Michel Platini’s previous record of nine goals in total at European Championships and became the first ever to score in five different editions of the competition. Against France, Ronaldo also equalled the world record for international goals held since 2006 by Iran’s Ali Daei — 109. There may be an added personal incentive for Ronaldo to outshine Lukaku, who pipped the Juventus striker to Serie A’s player of the season award last season despite scoring five fewer goals. Lukaku’s 24 goals were fundamental to Inter Milan’s Scudetto success but the 28-year-old’s work rate, pressing and link-up play meant he was more of an overall contributor than Ronaldo.In contrast, Ronaldo is all about the end-game — the goals, the victories and the trophies, with Portugal hoping to follow his lead.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/at-36-ronaldo-is-sparkling-again-on-the-big-stage-delivering-goals-and-breaking-records/articleshow/83878125.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-583664,resizemode-4,msid-83878125/at-36-ronaldo-dominates-the-world-stage-yet-again.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/sports/at-36-ronaldo-is-sparkling-again-on-the-big-stage-delivering-goals-and-breaking-records/articleshow/83878125.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T23:21:09+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Amazon-Future dispute: SIAC to hear from July 2</title><description>The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) will start its final hearing over a plea filed by e-commerce major Amazon against the Rs 24,713 crore deal between Future Group and Reliance Industries from July 2, according to a regulatory filing.  As per a regulatory filing by Future Consumer Ltd (FCL) on Saturday, a tribunal was constituted by SIAC for arbitration proceedings related to the Future-RIL deal on January 5, 2021.  The filing noted that "Future Retail Ltd(FRL) has filed two applications before the Tribunal, first being an application challenging the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; and second being an Application for vacation of the EA (Emergency Arbitrator) Order".  "As per the schedule finalised by the Tribunal, hearing for both the applications would commence on July 12, 2021," the March quarter 2021 earnings filing by FCL said.  In August last year, Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd had said it will acquire the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore. The scheme of arrangement entails the consolidation of Future Group's retail and wholesale assets into one entity Future Enterprises Ltd and then transferring it to Reliance Retail.  The deal has been contested by Amazon, an investor in Future Coupons that in turn, is a shareholder in FRL.  In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.  Amazon had dragged Future into arbitration at SIAC and in October, an interim award was passed by the EA in favour of the US-e-commerce major that barred Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.  Amazon and Future Group have also filed litigations in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, on the issue.  Future Consumer Ltd, in its filing on Saturday, said both FRL and Amazon have filed suit/ challenged each other's position relating to the deal/EA order in various courts of India and the matter is sub-judice and currently pending with Indian Courts for disposal.  In April, RIL had extended the timeline for completing the deal with Future Group by six months to September 30, 2021.  While the deal has received clearance from regulators such as CCI, SEBI and bourses, the scheme of arrangement is now awaiting the nod from the NCLT and shareholders.  "NCLT has heard the application relating to the Scheme (deal with Reliance) and the intervention application filed by Amazon and has reserved the order on the said application filed by Amazon," FCL said in the filing.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/siac-to-start-hearing-over-amazon-future-dispute-from-july-2/articleshow/83875452.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-495685,resizemode-4,msid-83875452/amazon-future-dispute-siac-to-hear-from-july-2.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/siac-to-start-hearing-over-amazon-future-dispute-from-july-2/articleshow/83875452.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T21:50:07+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Sajan Prakash secures automatic berth in Tokyo</title><description>Sajan Prakash on Saturday became the first-ever Indian swimmer to breach the Olympic qualification time, clocking 1:56:38 seconds in the men's 200m butterfly event at the Sette Colli Trophy in Rome, Italy.

However, the night curfew will remain in force in the state. Chouhan also said Madhya Pradesh has set a record for one more time with 9,64,756 doses of vaccines being administered till 7.30 pm since Saturday morning. "We are lifting Sunday's corona curfew with immediate effect. Those who want to open their shops, continue their economic activities, can do so in accordance with COVID-19 protocol," Chouhan tweeted. The pandemic has come under control in Madhya Pradesh as not a single COVID-19 positive case was registered in 35 districts in the state, he said. "For the first time, the number of active cases has fallen below 1,000. The case positivity rate has come down to 0.06%. In such a situation, it seems unreasonable to impose #coronacurfew on Sunday as well," he said. Chouhan also said vaccination will continue at a fast pace. "Till 7.30 pm on Saturday, 9,64,756 doses have been administered since morning. Madhya Pradesh has again set a record," he said. Madhya Pradesh on Saturday recorded 46 new cases of COVID-19 and 25 casualties that pushed the tally of infections to 7,89,657 and took the toll to 8,896, as per the state health department.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/mp-sunday-corona-curfew-to-be-lifted-as-pandemic-under-control-now-says-shivraj-chouhan/articleshow/83874093.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-563214,resizemode-4,msid-83874093/mp-sunday-corona-curfew-to-be-lifted-says-cm.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/mp-sunday-corona-curfew-to-be-lifted-as-pandemic-under-control-now-says-shivraj-chouhan/articleshow/83874093.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T20:25:01+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>India exports first consignment of Dragon Fruit</title><description>In a first, India has exported the fibre and mineral-rich exotic Dragon Fruit, the government said Saturday.

Its production commenced in India in early 1990s, the government said.“Dragon fruit goes to Dubai: In a major boost to export of exotic fruits, a consignment of the fibre &amp; mineral rich Dragon Fruit (Kamalam) sourced from farmers of Sangli, Maharashtra has been exported to Dubai,” commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said in a tweet.At present, dragon fruit is grown mostly in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The fruit contains fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It can help in repairing the cell damage caused by oxidative stress and reduce inflammation, and also improving the digestive system. Since the fruit has spikes and petals resembling lotus, it is also referred as ‘Kamalam’.APEDA or Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority promotes exports of agricultural and processed food products by providing assistance to the exporters under various components such as infrastructure development, quality development and market development.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-exports-first-consignment-of-dragon-fruit/articleshow/83873238.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-425050,resizemode-4,msid-83873238/india-exports-first-consignment-of-dragon-fruit.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/foreign-trade/india-exports-first-consignment-of-dragon-fruit/articleshow/83873238.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T19:17:15+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>PM Modi reviews Covid vaccination progress</title><description>Expressing satisfaction at an increased speed of COVID-19 vaccination this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said it is important to carry this momentum forward and also underlined a need to involve NGOs and other organisations in efforts to expand the drive.Over 3.77 crore Covid vaccine doses have been administered in the last six days, the government said in a statement after a high-level review meeting held by Modi with top officials on the progress of the vaccination drive.It was noted that 128 districts in the country have vaccinated more than 50 per cent of over 45 years of population and 16 districts have vaccinated more than 90 per cent of this age group."PM was informed that 3.77 crore doses have been administered in the last 6 days which is more than the entire population of countries like Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Canada," the Prime Minister's Office said.Modi also directed officials to work with states to ensure that the pace of testing does not go down as testing remains a very important weapon to track and contain rising infections in any regionModi underlined the need to involve NGOs and other organisations in the vaccination drive, with officials stating that they are in touch with state governments to explore and implement innovative methods to reach people for vaccination, the PMO said.Modi was also informed about the rising interest in Cowin platform globally, his office noted, adding that he said that efforts should be made to help all countries, who have expressed interest, with India's rich tech expertise in the form of Cowin platform.Officials gave a detailed presentation to Modi on the progress of inoculation in the country and was briefed about the age-wise vaccination coverage.He was also briefed about the vaccine coverage among healthcare workers, frontline workers and the general population in various states, the PMO said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/pm-modi-reviews-covid-vaccination-progress/articleshow/83873222.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-136811,resizemode-4,msid-83873222/pm-modi-reviews-covid-vaccination-progress.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/pm-modi-reviews-covid-vaccination-progress/articleshow/83873222.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T19:15:31+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Tomar appeals farmers to end 7-month long protest</title><description>As farmers' protest against the new farm laws entered eighth month, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday appealed to protesting farmers to end their agitation while saying that the government is ready to resume talks on the provisions of three legislations.The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers' protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for seven months now in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP.The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and has set up a committee to find solutions. The committee has submitted its report."I want to convey through your (media) that farmers should end their agitation. ....Many are in favour of these new laws across the country. Still, some farmers have any issue with provisions of the laws, Government of India is ready to listen and discuss with them," Tomar tweeted.He said the government held 11 rounds of consultations with protesting farmer unions. The government has increased the minimum support price (MSP) and is procuring more quantity at MSP.Farmers' protest had started on November 26 last year and has now completed seven months notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic. Three union ministers, including Tomar and Food Minister Piyush Goyal, have held 11 rounds of talks with the protesting farmer unions.In the last meeting on January 22, the government's negotiations with 41 farmer groups hit a roadblock as the unions squarely rejected the Centre's proposal of putting the laws on suspension.During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi's borders.The three laws -- The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by the Parliament in September last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse. Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) President Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati are the other members on the panel. They have completed the consultation process with stakeholders and submitted the report. </description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/narendra-singh-tomar-appeals-farmers-to-end-7-month-long-protest-says-ready-to-resume-talks/articleshow/83871349.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-793621,resizemode-4,msid-83871349/tomar-appeals-farmers-to-end-7-month-long-protest.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/narendra-singh-tomar-appeals-farmers-to-end-7-month-long-protest-says-ready-to-resume-talks/articleshow/83871349.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T17:44:33+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Delhi issues circular for schools till they reopen</title><description>The Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE) on Saturday issued a circular about conducting teaching-learning activities for 2021-22 in government and its aided schools from nursery to Class 12 till they reopen. The action plan for the session, encompassing the ''approach and implementation strategy" and divided into three stages, includes a staggered approach for students to ease into the teaching-learning process, read an official statement. "With the onset of the pandemic, learning loss has been massive. This year, we not only need to reduce the learning loss but also provide deep emotional support to our children. They need to be mentally prepared for any teaching-learning activities," said Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia in a statement. "This year, we will have close alignment between teaching-learning strategies and assessment so that the dependency on one time exam for year-end results is reduced," he added. He reiterated that while schools will remain closed until the situation of the Covid pandemic eases, the engagement between teachers and students will resume immediately, using "online and semi-online approach". The three stages will start from June 28, July 5 and August, respectively, it said. During the first stage, the teachers would update their students' contact details, make Whatsapp groups and prepare a list of those with smartphone, mobile phone or no phone, in the second stage they will introduce light activities like reading, writing and numeracy in classes up to eighth through worksheets, it said. "In classes 9 to 12, the focus would be recapitulating and understanding where the child currently is through online classes and worksheets, apart from supporting emotional wellbeing. The second stage will be till the end of July," it noted. The stage three, which will begin from August, would focus on class specific activities to bridge the learning loss. So where nursery to class 8 will receive generic and subject-specific worksheets, for classes 9 to 12, online classes by the respective subject teachers shall be conducted, it explained. According to the circular, short notes capturing important points of the online classes will be provided to students of 9 to 12 class having difficulty in accessing  digital devices.  "These notes can be collected by the parents from the school on a weekly basis. The parents who do not have smart phones can collect the worksheets on a weekly basis from the school of their child," it said. Also, according to the circular, this year, special emphasis would be given to assess students by conducting regular "monthly assessments" and using innovative approaches to understand the participation level and learning of students. "The nature of these assessments will be based on Project / Activity / Assignment. The record of such assessment shall be maintained by the schools which will be uploaded on students' modules as part of Internal/External assessment for the session 2021-2022," it added.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/delhi-govt-issues-circular-for-teaching-learning-activities-in-its-schools-till-they-reopen/articleshow/83871612.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-506607,resizemode-4,msid-83871612/delhi-issues-circular-for-schools-till-they-reopen.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/delhi-govt-issues-circular-for-teaching-learning-activities-in-its-schools-till-they-reopen/articleshow/83871612.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T17:48:59+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Shree Renuka Sugars to raise ethanol capacity</title><description>Shree Renuka Sugars will invest Rs 450 crore to expand its ethanol capacity, the company said on Saturday.

Corporate India displayed tremendous resilience in FY21, with the Nifty ending the year with a healthy (14 per cent) earnings growth, which was unthinkable a year back," the report said."The second Covid wave in April-May, 2021 has soured sentiments and impacted economic activity. Since the restrictions this time were localized and less stringent versus the lockdown in CY20, we expect the impact in 1QFY22 to be contained."According to the report, earnings momentum is expected to accelerate in FY22 as the pace of vaccinations picks up and the economy opens up further."BFSI and commodities are expected to drive FY22E earnings. The market has been strong and largely looked through the second Covid wave on the back of strong liquidity and robust participation from non-institutional investors.""The recent commentary by the (US) Fed on earlier than anticipated tapering and India's elevated CPI print have rattled some nerves, even as equity-bond yield dynamics are not showing any red flags."As per statement, Nifty valuations at '21x FY22E EPS' are rich and demand consistent earnings delivery ahead."Corporate earnings in the last quarter of FY21 continued the momentum of the preceding two quarters and ended the year on a good note, aided by the deflated base in 4QFY20 and healthy demand recovery for a large part of 4QFY21.""However, 1QFY22 has seen a familiar disruption, with the second COVID wave engulfing India and several states imposing lockdowns in Apr'21 and May'21."In addition, the trend of earnings revision has changed in favor of downgrades again in 4QFY21 after two consecutive quarters (2Q and 3QFY21) of upgrades."The downgrade-to-upgrade ratio stood at 1.6:1. The second COVID wave peaked in May'21 and active cases are currently 80 per cent below its peak.""Daily cases are trending at a three-month low. With the pace of vaccinations picking up and states unlocking again, confidence is gradually returning in corporate commentaries as we exit 1QFY22."</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/bfsi-commodities-expected-to-drive-fy22-earnings-mofsl/articleshow/83869475.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-538739,resizemode-4,msid-83869475/bfsi-commodities-expected-to-drive-fy22-earnings.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/bfsi-commodities-expected-to-drive-fy22-earnings-mofsl/articleshow/83869475.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T15:36:42+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Several Maoist top guns fall to COVID-19</title><description>Booming guns and skirmishes with the security forces in deep jungles are not the main sources of worry for Maoists at present. It is the dreaded coronavirus that hangs over their heads like a sword of Damocles in the red corridor spread across Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha.Though vector-borne chikungunya, dengue and malaria had claimed several lives of left-wing extremists operating from the jungles, the deadly effect of Covid-19 on top Maoist guns and cadres in the second wave was deep and stark.

And rightly so. India has witnessed an increase in forex reserves to $608 billion, which can provide some comfort.This reinstates the recent FPI’s bullishness in India, which was clearly visible in Nifty50’s P/E trading at 30.6 times, a 25% premium to its five-year average compared with the MSCI Emerging Index TTM P/E of 16.8 times.Markets have largely remained undeterred in their rise despite rising concerns around the headline and core inflation. While equities continued their joyride, a different narrative is doing the rounds in the commodity space. The rally in metals, which started back in 2020, has come to a halt.Talks from the Chinese authorities are hinting at inflationary control measures and US’ hawkish stance on interest rates is causing a retracement in metal prices. Now, if the letting off of the steam is just a minor hiccup in a supercycle or it is way past the top is a question up for deliberation. But one thing is clear, the sharp growth in commodity prices might not continue at the same pace going forward.Investors can, therefore, maintain a wait and watch approach and instead of relying on the commodity price movements, it would be essential to observe the deleveraging unfold on company balance sheets. The utilisation of capital and free cashflow trend over the next few months will help filter the strongest from the ordinary. Part profit booking can be considered on the next leg of bounce in metals stocks.Event of the WeekThis week gone by marked the fifth consecutive rise in oil futures, a 13.5% rise from over a month ago. Oil prices hitting multi-year highs can be attributed to a few distinct influences. First, global demand for oil is expected to reach pre-Covid levels by Q3FY22, as economies open up driven by a pickup in mobility in the US and Europe.Secondly, after the FOMC meet, the dollar gave up some strength, which helped commodity prices, especially crude. Additionally, the lack of investment by global oil majors in new capacity due to reforms around ESG, can also cause a supply scarcity leading to a further uptick in crude prices. Traders betting on oil are advised to keep a trailing stop loss in place before betting on higher prices.Technical OutlookNifty50 has been trading sideways for almost three weeks now. It seems to be facing a temporary halt after a period of outperformance. Overall market sentiments in global indices look positive, and eventually, Nifty is also likely to catch up. After a strong bounceback from 15,450 level, this zone is now being established as a crucial short-term support. We advise traders to maintain a bullish bias on the market and remain watchful for any break of the crucial support, as this would lead to weakness in the short term.        83865621Expectations for the WeekThe domestic bourses are likely to move in tandem with the global indices in the coming week. In order to gauge the revival of sentiment at the ground level, market participants would have their focus on June auto sales numbers. The market is pricing in a strong rebound in volumes this month on expectations of pentup demand from April, May owing to accelerated vaccination drives throughout the country, a strong line-up of launches, all-time low auto loan rates and a favourable monsoon.Investors are advised to closely watch the unlock theme stocks, as they could see knee-jerk reactions depending on the development in the delta variant. Nifty50 closed the week at 15,860, up 1.13 per cent.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-a-deadlock-between-bulls-bears-book-profit-in-metals-on-every-rise/articleshow/83865687.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-918641,resizemode-4,msid-83865687/its-a-deadlock-between-bulls-amp-bears.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/its-a-deadlock-between-bulls-bears-book-profit-in-metals-on-every-rise/articleshow/83865687.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T11:33:13+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>CJI flags issue of digital connectivity</title><description>Chief Justice of India N V Ramana has written to Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad seeking steps to resolve the poor digital connectivity in rural, tribal, remote and hilly areas that is "adversely impacting the pace of justice delivery". The CJI referred to the digital divide and said that "a whole generation of lawyers is being pushed out of the system" due to the technological inequality. He was speaking during the release of a book, 'Anomalies in Law and Justice', authored by former Supreme Court Judge Justice R V Raveendran in a virtual function here.  During the course of the panel discussion that followed the launch of the book, he informed that the matter of connectivity figured prominently in the two-day conference of chief justices of high courts that he had held recently.  "The poor connectivity in rural, tribal, remote and hilly areas is adversely impacting the pace of justice delivery and is also depriving thousands of young lawyers across the country of their livelihood.  "A whole generation of lawyers is being pushed out of the system due to digital divide," the CJI said.  Justice Ramana also said that he recently wrote to the minister of Law, Communications and IT highlighting these issues and requested him to initiate steps on priority to bridge the digital divide and also to evolve a mechanism to help the advocates who have lost livelihood due to the Covid pandemic and who are in dire need of financial assistance.  The CJI also highlighted the need to declare the legal professionals and associated functionaries as frontline workers and the need to vaccinate them all on priority.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/cji-writes-to-law-minister-seeking-steps-to-resolve-poor-digital-connectivity-in-rural-remote-areas/articleshow/83870314.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-472240,resizemode-4,msid-83870314/cji-flags-issue-of-digital-connectivity.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/cji-writes-to-law-minister-seeking-steps-to-resolve-poor-digital-connectivity-in-rural-remote-areas/articleshow/83870314.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T16:29:38+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Farmers march: Delhi police ups security</title><description>The Delhi Police on Saturday tightened security arrangements across borders of the national capital in view of the anticipated protest march by farmers, officials said.Saturday marks the completion of seven months of the protests by the farmers, ever since they began their stir by camping at Singhu border between Delhi and Haryana. The other two protest sites on the national capital's borders are Tikri and Ghazipur.The protesting farmers have demanded the withdrawal of the Centre's new farm laws and that a new law be made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.The Delhi Metro has decided to shut its three main stations on the Yellow Line for four hours on Saturday."As advised by Delhi Police, in view of security reasons, three Metro stations of Yellow Line namely, Vishwavidyalaya, Civil Lines and Vidhan Sabha will remain closed for public from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm tomorrow i.e, 26.06.2021 (Saturday)," the DMRC had tweeted Friday night.According to a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions protesting at various Delhi border points, “Kheti Bachao, Loktantra Bachao Diwas” (save agriculture, save democracy) is being marked all over India on Saturday on the completion of seven months of the farmers' protests and 46 years after promulgation of Emergency in India in 1975.Thousands of farmers across India plan to march in rallies to Raj Bhavans in different states on Saturday.

In a candid emailer with Modi, he tells ET Panache how he’s upskilled, what he looks forward to and what has boosted his mood during the lockdown.First things first: The first thing I intend to do once restrictions are lifted is to travel to some of my favourite destinations and indulge in some actual retail therapy; I think I’ve had enough of online shopping. Second on my list would be a spa treatment; I would love to just sit down, close my eyes, take a few deep breaths, and rejuvenate myself.Take off: When it comes to travel, Florence is my first choice. You can take in the beauty of its soulful architecture and mesmerising art sculptures on foot, enjoy shopping at quirky shops and revel in the variety of food the city offers. Second would be London as it exudes vibrant vibes and is my go-to holiday destination. Vegas is another great spot, but I will not delve further because what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Now that my kids are all grown up and we share similar interests in photography, I would love to take my family on a Safari to Africa and create lasting memories.Treat yourself: I really am looking forward to a day at the salon. I am tired of shaving my beard, colouring my hair, doing my pedicure and manicure. The thing about pampering is that you cannot do it to yourself. I want to just sit back and relax.Food for thought: I am a foodie and love exploring local cuisine while travelling. I have missed the taste of some of my most-liked foods so much that I have started experimenting at home by searching for their recipes on the web. However, once the lockdown lifts, I want to go back to Kai in Mayfair, London - which is one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants, Chili Club in Hong Kong, Nara Thai in Bangkok and Zuma for amazing Japanese food in London. Retail therapy: I would recommend Bicester Village just outside London. It is outlet shopping and great fun to visit. It is home to over 100 British and International fashion boutiques and one of the few places that can quench my shopaholic soul. There isn’t any particular thing I wish I had purchased before the lockdown, but I do miss my clothes shopping as I cannot do that over the net.Tech update: I love the way technology has evolved. I have added a face-tracking camera to my conference facility set-up at home. I could be sitting anywhere in the room; the camera automatically identifies my face and ensures that I am in focus. It has made my interactions over virtual modes more interesting.WFH hack: Over the years I have come to realise that if you want to be productive, you need to find the right balance in life. During this pandemic and WFH I have been able to connect with nature once again at my farmhouse. I enjoy short walks between meetings. This helps me strike a balance and keeps me at peak form. On a lighter note, I have perfected the art of the formal-casual attire for video calls. I happily wear formal shirts on lounge pyjamas for a comfortable workday.Mood boost: My favourite pastime these days is listening to podcasts and music on Spotify, watching movies on Netflix and shopping on Amazon. I’ve got back to cooking as well during the pandemic. I love setting up meals for my family and the entire processreally helps me relax.Upskilling: Since I am home, I have been able to devote more time to my old hobbies and passions, photography and cooking, which has led me to become more active on Instagram. I love taking pictures of ‘Minky’,the resident monkey and the peacocks visiting my garden. Also, with the extra time on my hands, I have been able to cook more often. I have been learning how to make the food that I have been craving such as Eton Mess, Japanese Ramen, Sardar ki pav bhaji, Morning Glory from Nara Thai, Mexican churros, and the quintessential Donald Duck favourite, meringues. I have recently been purchasing a motley mix of items; Japanese Ramen cookbooks, a smart pressure cooker that guides you to cook up hundreds of recipes and a special frying pan &amp; turner that has been developed by a Michelin Star Chef in Japan to make the perfect omelette.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/samir-modi-has-had-enough-of-online-shopping-pandemic-saw-him-renew-passion-for-photography-and-cooking/articleshow/83865208.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-660122,resizemode-4,msid-83865208/samir-modi-has-had-enough-of-online-shopping.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/samir-modi-has-had-enough-of-online-shopping-pandemic-saw-him-renew-passion-for-photography-and-cooking/articleshow/83865208.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T17:20:08+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>U.S. has no explanation for unidentified objects</title><description>The government still has no explanation for nearly all of the scores of unidentified aerial phenomena reported over almost two decades and investigated by a Pentagon task force, according to a report released Friday, a result that is likely to fuel theories of otherworldly visitations.A total of 143 reports gathered since 2004 remain unexplained, the document released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. Of those, 21 reports of unknown phenomena, involving 18 episodes, possibly demonstrate technological capabilities that are unknown to the United States: objects moving without observable propulsion or with rapid acceleration that is believed to be beyond the capabilities of Russia, China or other terrestrial nations. But, the report said, more rigorous analysis of those episodes is needed.There is no evidence that any of the episodes involve secret U.S. weapons programs, unknown technology from Russia or China or extraterrestrial visitations. But the government report did not rule out those explanations.The nine-page document essentially declines to draw conclusions, announcing that the available reporting is “largely inconclusive” and noting that limited and inconsistent data created a challenge in evaluating the phenomena.The report said the number of sightings was too limited for a detailed pattern analysis. While they clustered around military training or testing grounds, the report found that could be the result of collection bias or the presence of cutting-edge sensors in those areas.Government officials outlined a plan to develop, if added funding is available, a better program to observe and collect data on future unexplained phenomena.The failure to reach a conclusion on the unexplained episodes raised questions about how seriously the government has taken them until now and whether it had assembled adequate scientific expertise to examine them.Among the unexplained incidents are three high-profile videos of aerial phenomena taken by the U.S. Navy and witnessed by pilots in recent years.The report released Friday is an interim report, which is how former officials involved in the Pentagon examination had predicted the government would initially handle the requirement by Congress to submit an unclassified report on what it knows about UFOs.The government intends to update Congress within 90 days on efforts to develop an improved collection strategy and what officials are calling a technical road map to develop technology to better observe the phenomena, senior government officials told reporters Friday. Officials said they would provide lawmakers with periodical updates beyond that.The Pentagon and intelligence agencies have eschewed the term unidentified flying object and refer instead to unidentified aerial phenomena. It has been a bit of rebranding, both to cut down on public enthusiasm and remove the stigma that UFO can carry, in order to encourage pilots to report their observations and scientists to study them.The new report laid out five categories of possible explanation for the phenomena: a secret technology developed by an adversarial power like Russia and China, classified cutting-edge U.S. technology, a naturally occurring phenomenon, airborne clutter such as errant weather balloons and a catchall “other” category. That final group could include extraterrestrial technology.But of the episodes examined by the task force, only one could be identified and categorized: "a large, deflating balloon" that was classified as airborne clutter.Officials do not have any indications that the unexplained incidents show objects that are part of a foreign intelligence collection program or a major technological advancement by a potential adversary, a senior government official said. They are also unable to confirm that any of those incidents are part of a U.S. government or defense industry program, a senior official said.Nevertheless, the report does not completely rule out a Russian or Chinese aircraft or a U.S. classified program.The report is being made public because of a provision inserted by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, into a huge spending bill passed by Congress.“The Defense Department and intelligence community have a lot of work to do before we can actually understand whether these aerial threats present a serious national security concern,” Rubio said.Of the incidents examined by the task force, there are “no clear indications that there is any nonterrestrial explanation” for them, said a senior official, adding that the government would “go wherever the data takes us” as the inquiry continued.The report avoids any real discussion of the possibility the unexplained phenomena are extraterrestrial in nature. It was not the purpose of the government’s task force to search for extraterrestrial life, a responsibility that falls to NASA, said a senior governmental official.There are plausible, but dry, explanations for each of the Navy recordings that are more likely than some sort of extraordinary technology, said Mick West, a science writer who focuses on debunking conspiracy theories.In one video, a sharp movement of the object could be attributable to a shift in the camera’s movement. In another, an object that appears to be moving fast is shown to be actually moving much more slowly when a relevant trigonometric calculation is applied. An image of a rapidly spinning object skimming over the clouds is caused by infrared glare, West said.The report appeared to give West’s explanations at least a partial vote of confidence by noting that the vantage point of the sensors capturing images or other data is important in determining whether an object “demonstrates breakthrough aerospace capabilities.”“They’re not making any big claims; they’re saying some of the things they see seem to show unusual behavior, and more study is needed,” West said. “Obviously, they’re not saying it’s aliens — they’re not going anywhere near that.”Later on Friday, the Pentagon announced it would develop procedures to collect data and analyze reports of unidentified phenomena, adding staffing and other resources to examine the episodes.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/u-s-has-no-explanation-for-unidentified-objects-and-stops-short-of-ruling-out-aliens/articleshow/83867308.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-542329,resizemode-4,msid-83867308/u-s-has-no-explanation-for-unidentified-objects.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/science/u-s-has-no-explanation-for-unidentified-objects-and-stops-short-of-ruling-out-aliens/articleshow/83867308.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T13:15:40+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>India conducted 40 cr COVID-19 tests: ICMR</title><description>India has achieved the milestone of conducting 40 crore COVID-19 tests, with the average of more than 18 lakh tests per day in the month of June, the ICMR said on Saturday. India has tested 40,18,11,892 samples across the country till Friday, it said. The country tested 35 crore COVID-19 samples till June 1, 2021. "This has been enabled by rapidly increasing testing infrastructure and capacity across the country. ICMR has been enhancing COVID-19 testing capability across the country by expanding and diversifying testing capacity by leveraging technology and facilitating innovation in affordable diagnostic kits," the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said in a statement. Prof Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR said exponential increase in testing has led to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of COVID-19 cases. These have eventually resulted in a sustained low fatality rate. "This testing milestone is testimony to the fact that India has been successful in implementing the strategy of 5T approach 'Test, Track, Trace, Treat and use of Technology' efficiently, which will enable us to contain the spread of the pandemic," the statement quoted Bhargava as saying.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-achieves-milestone-of-conducting-40-crore-covid-19-tests-icmr/articleshow/83867110.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-542487,resizemode-4,msid-83867110/india-conducted-40-cr-covid-19-tests-icmr.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-achieves-milestone-of-conducting-40-crore-covid-19-tests-icmr/articleshow/83867110.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T12:53:10+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>India is 'incredibly important' partner to US : WH</title><description>India is an "incredibly important" partner to the US in the region and globally, the White House has said, underlining that America is working with the country on wide-ranging issues like economic, strategic and security. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Friday said that the US took a range of steps to help India to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. "India is an incredibly important partner to the United States in the region and globally. We work with India on a range of issues, as you well know -- economic, strategic, security," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference. "The United States certainly took a range of steps, as India was at the early stages of dealing with a rise in the pandemic, to help provide a range of assistance, and we will continue to do that moving forward," Psaki said in response to a question. In April and May, India struggled with the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new cases. Hospitals were reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds. In mid-May, new coronavirus cases in India hit a record daily high with 4,12,262 new infections. In May, President Joe Biden announced USD 100 million worth of COVID-19 assistance to India.  The US-India Chambers of Commerce Foundation has raised more than USD 1.2 million for coronavirus-related efforts in India.  With a record-breaking fundraising, US-India Chambers of Commerce Foundation has shipped or en route nearly 120 ventilators and over 1,000 oxygen concentrators, a release said on June 3.  Also, India will be a significant recipient of the US vaccines after Biden announced details of his administration's decision to send 25 million COVID-19 shots to countries across the globe. India has been included in both the identified categories - direct supply to neighbours and partner countries, and under the COVAX initiative. On June 4, Vice President Kamala Harris personally made a call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inform him about the administration's decision to send tens of thousands of doses of life-saving COVID-19 vaccines to India.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-is-incredibly-important-partner-to-united-states-in-the-region-and-globally-white-house/articleshow/83866516.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-168567,resizemode-4,msid-83866516/india-is-incredibly-important-partner-to-us-wh.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/india-is-incredibly-important-partner-to-united-states-in-the-region-and-globally-white-house/articleshow/83866516.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T12:20:53+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>4 sectors that had an impressive Q4 earnings season</title><description>Metals, banking and financial services, pharma and IT are the four sectors that reported strong earnings growth in the quarter gone by, says Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Edited excerpts:As per our assessments of Q4 earnings, there has been an overall growth in EPS. Results have not been too bad for corporate India. What have you made of the earnings trajectory? Is there any specific sector that stood out to you?The 14% earnings growth in FY21 has been the best in the last 11 years. That kind of a momentum in a pandemic year shows the underlying strength of corporate earnings. And now cases in the second wave are coming down sharply and vaccination is picking up. This will lead to a strong demand uptick in the coming quarters and that should only lead to a much higher growth rate. One sector that clearly stood out was metals. It has been at the forefront of the earnings growth. Some other sectors which did well were already factored in. For example, banking and financial space. On the back of lower provisioning and improvement in asset quality, they continued to report growth. Pharma and IT are the two other sectors that reported strong earnings growth in the quarter gone by.Where within the pharma space are you finding comfort now?While there have been opportunities in the last couple of months in the pharma space because of the vaccine, but if you look at the big picture there has been a huge demand growth in some developed markets. That is where you will see some large generic players doing very well in the coming quarters. In API, the incremental demand is shifting out of China into countries like India. That segment will continue to benefit on a longer timeframe. In the near-term, vaccine continues to give support to some key players. One should focus on the big macro picture which is improvement in demand, improvement in realisation and the biggest point is improvement in the regulatory environment, especially in US. That should be positive for large generic players as well as API manufacturers.Why the underperformance in Reliance even after a big bang 44th AGM?In Reliance there was some outperformance prior to the AGM in anticipation. If you look at the stock price performance vis-à-vis Nifty, there were a lot of expectations. The big announcement of entry into clean energy space is not a disappointment but it is a big capex plan that does come into play now. There are no define timelines to a lot of announcements. Overall, the company would continue to do well. The oil and gas segment could surprise with Saudi Aramco chairman joining the board. The problem is that we have not yet got the details and timeline of investments. As and when those are unveiled, it would definitely support the stock.What is the outlook when it comes to the entire real estate pocket?If you look at the overall trend, there has been an improvement in demand. Some of the companies have reported higher sales during the last few quarters. The realisation has largely remained stable. That has helped some of these companies to report good growth in numbers. While the recovery is being supported by the increasing demand for housing and low interest rates, we believe that the housing side could continue to do well in the coming quarters. The interest rates are low, savings are high and the focus of people on owning a house has improved post pandemic.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/four-sectors-that-had-an-impressive-q4-earnings-season/articleshow/83844126.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-356388,resizemode-4,msid-83844126/4-sectors-that-had-an-impressive-q4-earnings-season.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/expert-view/four-sectors-that-had-an-impressive-q4-earnings-season/articleshow/83844126.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T09:04:28+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>How you and your money can stay ahead of inflation</title><description>The inflation monster, dormant for the last few years, is rearing its ugly head again. As the economy gets back on its feet, inflation seems primed to tag along and spoil the party. Recent price uptick in metals and fuel, along with power, took wholesale inflation to a high of 12.94% in May. Consumer price inflation also shot up to 6.3%, compared to 4.3% in the previous month.Prices of essential commodities are rising at a fast clip and eating into the purchasing power of consumers. Cooking oils and pulses are particularly dear. Last month, the average retail price of packed edible oils soared to the highest in over a decade. The monthly average retail price of sunflower oil (packed) stands at Rs 174 per kg—56% higher than a year ago. Prices of tur (arhar) dal and chana dal have also risen sharply over the past year. At a time when many households are consuming more food in the current work- and study from-home environment, the rising prices are stretching kitchen budgets.Both wholesale and retail prices have shot up            83660310In Mumbai, 34-year-old Akanksha Mishra has seen her weekly spend on vegetables double from Rs 300-400 to Rs 600-800. During the lockdown, her monthly household spend on food jumped from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. Like her, many have seen a shakeup in their usual consumption basket amid covid-driven realities.It is time for everyone to confront this reality. If inflation surges, household budgets will go out of whack. It will steadily gnaw away at your purchasing power and eat into investment returns. But you can tackle it better by being prepared.Why to expect rising inflationThere are several reasons why inflation is likely to become entrenched in the near term. The commodity reflation trend playing out over the past few months is not likely to slow down. Brent crude prices crossed $70 per barrel in recent weeks, more than double of what it was a year ago. In India, the price of petrol is already over Rs 100 per litre in places. Prices of base metals have also surged. Global economic recovery and resumption of manufacturing activity will keep prices of key metals on the boil.Edible oils and fuel are among the main culprits behind price uptick            83660407Global inflation creeps into emerging economies through commodities. Higher commodity prices eventually reflect in items of daily consumption, albeit with a lag. Higher fuel prices will show up as heightened transportation costs. Elevated prices of commodities that serve as raw material for manufacturers will find their way into prices of consumer goods. While producers are currently bearing the burden of rising input costs, these can get easily get passed on to consumers as demand revives, finds CRISIL Research. The pandemic has spread to hitherto untouched smaller towns and villages. The resulting disruptions may harm farm output and send food prices soaring.Global commodities have been on the boil            83660415Further, central banks worldwide seem hesitant to rein in the easy money conditions they have persisted with for years. Developed countries have unleashed a tidal wave of liquidity to combat covid-led contraction in economic activity. The stance of the US Fed has shifted to tolerate higher inflation. “Central banks are not in a hurry to take the foot off the gas pedal. In the battle between inflation and growth, policy is clearly gravitating towards reviving growth,” says Ankur Maheshwari, CEO, Wealth Management, Equirus Capital. But many argue this will come at a steep cost. Already, consumer inflation has touched 5% threshold in the US—for the second time in 30 years. Sankaran Naren, CIO and Executive Director, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, argues, “With the amount of money being printed globally, you can’t just wish away inflation. Until recently, this money went into assets, but post-covid it is seeping into commodities and goods.”The RBI has been striving to keep retail inflation below its 6% tolerance threshold. Its comfort zone has now been breached. But the RBI will continue to ignore it for now as supporting growth is priority. This is likely to give more rope to inflation.How to stay aheadIf inflation digs in its heels, it will take a larger bite out of your savings. When inflation rises, the purchasing power of money comes down and over time, inflation eats into the returns any asset generates. Your priority then is to ensure that your money grows faster than inflation or at least keeps your purchasing power intact. Here are a few pointers on what you should do now:Recalibrate budgetRising inflation will first send your household budget haywire. The amount you earmark for monthly spend on necessities and discretionary items will prove insufficient. The first step is to get a tighter grip on your expenses. Raj Khosla, Founder and MD, MyMoneyMantra, suggests a workaround: “Figure out how you can cover monthly expenses living off only 70% of your monthly income.” This will help in realigning your consumption and build a cushion against rising prices.It is crucial to get a fix on your own inflation rate. The headline inflation numbers can be misleading. Even if headline numbers suggest inflation is 6%, it may be actually much higher for you. This is because inflation is personal, driven by consumption habits particular to each household. Monitoring your personal rate and identifying the high inflation areas can help put a lid on lifestyle inflation. Besides, inflation rate is a key input in the financial planning exercise. It forms the basis for estimating certain big-ticket expenses in future and identifying the investment needed to fund those. If actual inflation turns out to be even 1-2% higher than estimate, it can jeopardise goals.Your inflation is not my inflationActual inflation rate can vary widely as consumption baskets or spending patterns of households can differ vastly from one to the other.          83660489Review outstanding loansIf interest rates trend upwards in the near term, you may want to review your existing loans. Some lenders have already hiked rates. For instance, SBI restored minimum home loan rates to 6.95% from 1 April, withdrawing its limited period offer of 6.7%. Others may follow suit. When rates rise, banks typically extend the loan tenure rather than hike the EMI. This stretches your total interest outgo. If saddled with debt, try and reduce the outstanding through partial prepayments before rates rise. “Your first priority should be to pay back as much of existing loans as you can afford to,” says Khosla. This will keep interest outgo in check should loans get repriced upwards. Consider liquidating low-yield investments to fund repayments.Even a 0.5% difference in rate can lead to big savings in interest outgo            83660512If paying off a higher cost loan, it may be a good idea to move it lower on the interest ladder. Amid sliding interest rates over the past few years, home loan rates fell to historic lows. However, not all borrowers benefitted. Those still on older rates with many years of repayment left should consider a balance transfer to another lender. Ensure the potential savings on interest outgo are higher than the processing fee charged by the new lender. Those paying off multiple loans may consider consolidating into a single loan with lower interest charge.Maintain allocation to equitiesFinancial planners say equities remain the best answer to inflation. Maheshwari asserts, “Equities have the ability to counter inflation over the long run. Investors must incrementally look to build risk in portfolio to fetch real rate of return.” Experts find echoes of the 2003-08 corporate earnings upcycle in the turning interest rate and inflation scenario today. This multi-year uptick occurred in the aftermath of bottoming out of interest rates and pick up in inflation. “Companies are able to borrow at very low rates at the turn of the cycle and generate high double-digit return on capital in the following years,” explains Kirtan Shah, Founder and CEO, SRE Wealth.            83660575Higher oil prices are also not necessarily negative for the stock markets. On the contrary, Indian stocks have performed well in times of higher oil prices. “Sovereign wealth funds originating in oil-producing nations have surpluses to invest at such times. These make their way into strategic and long term stakes in many companies,” says Mayank Khemka, CIO India, Deutsche Bank.During times of inflation, investors typically gravitate towards larger businesses— perceived to have the pricing power to pass on higher input costs to consumers. But it may not be the right approach, feels Feroze Azeez, Deputy CEO, Anand Rathi Wealth Management. “Don’t rush to large caps at the first signs of inflation. Many mid-caps will remain agnostic to inflation driven capital outflows as this basket doesn’t have high participation from foreign investors.” His advice? Investors maintain 30% exposure to this segment.At a broader level, rise in input costs will impact margins of many companies. “With the uncertainty in demand environment, it will be challenging for companies to pass on rise in commodity costs,” remark analysts at Motilal Oswal. Auto, consumer staples and durables would be highly impacted in such a scenario. More importantly, the uptick in inflation could signal the end of the monetary easing cycle, which has kept funding cost low for businesses and contributed to healthy margins.However, a section of India Inc should thrive in this environment. Metals and oil and gas sectors (upstream companies) will continue to benefit. Motilal Oswal analysts believe metal companies are likely to see superior profitability in 2021-22, which would drive sharp reduction in leverage. Among steel companies, SAIL is more sensitive to steel prices. In the non-ferrous space, Nalco and Vedanta are the biggest beneficiaries of higher aluminium prices.Kotak Securities prefers GAIL over upstream oil PSUs as a hedge against higher crude prices as it benefits from an increase in profitability of LPG production and LNG marketing segments. The brokerage wants investors to avoid ONGC and OIL as a play on crude prices, despite its higher direct leverage on their profits. This is due to an uninspiring production track record amid sustained increase in expenditure, limited free cash flow generation and deteriorating returns due to inefficient capital allocation. Mutual fund investors can participate in this space by investing in select thematic funds like DSP Natural Resources and New Energy, Tata Resources and Energy or ICICI Prudential Commodities Fund.Take gold exposureOver the years, gold has preserved its purchasing power. Unlike currencies, gold cannot be printed and so remains far less susceptible to government manipulation. Even as fiat currencies have lost value, gold has remained a stable store of value.In the present negative real yield environment, the confidence in fiat currencies is likely to be low. For instance, the US 10-year Treasury bill currently yields 1.44%—lower than expected inflation rate. So a long-term investor in US treasuries is almost guaranteed to lose a small amount of purchasing power over the life of the bond. This makes holding gold a more viable option.Gold is a hedge against inflation over long term            83660647Hitesh Jain, Lead Analyst – Institutional Equities, YES Securities insists that rising inflationary trends should be conducive for gold. “Despite rising inflationary trend, Fed is not keen on normalising monetary policy for some time. As a result, we will likely live with a weak dollar and ringfenced US 10 year yields—yet another narrative of negative real yields that will work for gold.” Experts insist 10-15% allocation to gold is always a good strategy. Any investment in the precious metal should be in the form of paper gold.Invest in floating rate bondsThe fixed income part of the portfolio struggles amid inflation. Rising inflation pushes interest rates higher, pulling down prices of longer tenure bonds. Fixed deposits gradually lose purchasing power as real interest rates turn negative. However, there are better alternatives in this space.Stay invested in shorter duration debt funds, particularly those aligned to accrual strategy. These will not be exposed to capital depreciation if interest rates rise, and will benefit from rising coupons. The ideal bets are floating rate bonds. These are bonds where the interest rate is pegged to a reference benchmark rate. With every change in the benchmark rate, the rate on the floating rate bond also changes. Shah remarks, “In a rising interest rate scenario, the floating rate bonds will adjust their coupons upwards and so the fund will be able to capture higher yields.”Years ago, fixed income investors could take recourse to inflation indexed bonds. However, these are not sold in the market today. A close proxy is RBI floating rate bonds. Interest rate (currently at 7.15%) is arrived at by adding 0.35% to the prevailing NSC rate, which is reviewed every quarter as per prevailing yields on government securities. However, rate transmission can be erratic as the government may not always realign rate as per formula.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/plan/inflation-to-rise-in-near-term-how-to-manage-household-budget-loan-emis-and-investment-returns/articleshow/83660159.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-535611,resizemode-4,msid-83660159/how-you-and-your-money-can-stay-ahead-of-inflation.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/plan/inflation-to-rise-in-near-term-how-to-manage-household-budget-loan-emis-and-investment-returns/articleshow/83660159.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-21T06:30:00+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>View: Advanced Wi-Fi tech will change the world</title><description>The Covid-19 crisis had caught companies by complete surprise last year, and as the nationwide lockdown was announced, enterprises scrambled to keep BCPs (business continuity plans) going. While digitally-savvy businesses barely missed a stride in shifting to WFH (work from home) or WFA (work from anywhere), others struggled to keep operations going. Almost overnight, the criticality of digital and wireless networks became universally apparent. Many businesses without the wherewithal to go digital have either gone bust or rendered irrelevant. The success of digital initiatives is often contingent on the network, especially Wi-Fi, a primary connectivity juncture between the Internet and diverse devices. Wi-Fi is like air, you cannot see it or touch it, but it is essential to breathing life into all-digital experiences. Wi-Fi will continue to play a pivotal role in empowering businesses post-pandemic, enabling people to stay connected as capacity and connectivity needs of all expand.A recent Deloitte study on the adoption of advanced wireless systems such as Wi-Fi 6 shows accelerating digital transformation after the pandemic. Such has been its proliferation that market penetration of Wi-Fi-enabled devices has already surpassed 10 billion – this is more than the world's population and carrying 55% of the global internet traffic, the share of which is rapidly increasing over Wi-Fi.The latest generation Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E (Wi-Fi 6 in the pristine 6 GHz Band) has debuted and will take some time to attain mass-market adoption. The work is already underway on next-gen standards such as Wi-Fi 7 for future needs - higher bandwidth, superlative speed, lowest latency possible and most efficient power utilisation. Wi-Fi will give impetus to innovation that will encourage digital leaps by not just supporting existing use cases such as online learning, remote working, and telemedicine, but would also help realise future use cases such as driverless cars, advanced biometrics at airports, remote building management, Extended Reality (AR /VR/MR) and smart farming, among many others. In one word, 'resilience' has spurred increased wireless investments to fortify an enterprise's capability in addressing present and future business disruptions. Organisational transformations that would once span years are now possible in months as we have seen recently. The velocity at which tectonic changes are happening will not be surprising to see strategic shifts actualising in weeks, sometime in the not too distant future.Wi-Fi has become a ubiquitous aspect of modern life. In organisations today, secure wireless systems are imperative to connect employees, customers, and machines seamlessly for robust remote working capabilities, rising automation, hassle-free access to data on fingertips, and fully digital service delivery. Who would've thought that 4K videoconferences and HD virtual summits would be the new norm to do business and reach stakeholders globally without leaving your room! Similarly, as conventional academic sessions remain suspended since March 2020, digital learning has bridged the gap, while enabling teachers and students to connect daily. This ensures continuous learning and creative collaboration despite lockdowns or geographical constraints. Wi-Fi has not only helped drive the explosive multimedia content consumption on OTT platforms, but Wi-Fi 6 has also done away with any dizziness while using high-end VR/AR (virtual/augmented reality) devices. It is now possible to get a true-to-life digital experience of walking down any street of the world in the finest detail without stepping out the door or play high-framerate games in the cinematic resolution that test the limits of the naked human eye. Considering the growing demand for open interoperability at homes, deploying a mesh network will be the next big thing to set up multiple Access Points and Routers that will cover every inch of the house without any drop in bandwidth, speed, or latency, providing blanket coverage.Likewise, in healthcare, telemedicine has helped save the day and lives. Remote diagnosis &amp; consultation, online testing, and real-time monitoring are not only gaining preference among patients, but such capabilities are also enabling healthcare fraternity to beat the odds of the patient-doctor ratio. What's more, legacy sectors such as agriculture are benefitting from 24x7 connectivity. Wi-Fi has paved the way for farmers to stay updated and brings vital information right in their hands through phone as they now check weather information, sowing patterns, crop prices at mandis and much more digitally. Further, the game-changer will be smart &amp; organised farming that will be backed by drones monitoring crop health and field-based IoT devices to gauge soil humidity, weather conditions, and allied environmental factors to boost farm productivity with efficient resource utilisation. Wi-Fi SENS is a new standard for motion tracking and environment mapping using Wi-Fi signals that will find application in all environments that it talks to - be it home, hospitals, schools, offices, airports, hospitality etc. This reflects the infinite possibilities of Wi-Fi, its innovative use cases to come and how each one of us will be touched by its understated, transformative role in digital acceleration across the world.(The writer is managing director, HFCL)</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/view-possibilities-are-infinite-with-advanced-wi-fi-technology/articleshow/83866086.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-152898,resizemode-4,msid-83866086/view-advanced-wi-fi-tech-will-change-the-world.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/view-possibilities-are-infinite-with-advanced-wi-fi-technology/articleshow/83866086.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T12:10:38+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Maha: Level 3 is now base level, no further easing</title><description>Bracing for a surge in Covid-19 cases brought on by the highly transmissible Delta-plus variant, Maharashtra has rolled back relaxations in districts and cities where theatres, malls, multiplexes had opened and private firms were permitted 100% staffing. This includes Navi Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Pune.        83861712The government has effectively done away with the first two levels of unlocking —Level 1 and 2—that offered the most relaxations, citing the potential threat of an “imminent” third wave which is expected to be “more severe”, according to an order by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Friday. This does not change anything for Mumbai, though, which is at Level 3 despite being eligible for Level 1. All districts and cities in Level 1 or 2 will slip to 3.         83861725Irrespective of indicators like weekly positivity rate and oxygen bed occupancy, unlocking will now be only at three levels, starting with 3 at the easiest and going up to level 5. Those at level 4 and 5 will continue to face the restrictions applicable.Most cities in MMR will be at level 3, except places in Raigad district which were at 4 last week. Going by indicators last week, there were 25 districts in the state eligible for level 1, 8 at level 3 and 3 at level 4.“This revision has been done in the wake of the emergence of the Delta-Plus variant and the advisory received from the Centre and the state task force. The Delta-Plus variant is a huge cause of concern and we cannot afford to take it leniently,” said Aseem Gupta, relief and rehabilitation secretary. The order says new variants like Delta, Delta-Plus, may precipitate a more severe third wave in 4-6 weeks across a wider geographical area. So far, 21 cases of the Delta-Plus variant have been reported from Maharashtra—nine in Ratnagiri, seven in Jalgaon, two in Mumbai and one each in Thane, Palghar and Sindhudurg. “A big problem this time is that the public was just not co-operating. Crowding, no adherence to health norms were being reported on a large scale,” said an official. To make the mechanism stricter, the government will allow ranking to shift to an easier level only after a declining trend is observed for two weeks. Earlier, decisions were based on a week’s data. However, to tighten, a two-week period may not be considered and districts will not require permission from the government to impose fresh restrictions. Also, to determine the weekly positivity rate, only RT-PCR tests will be taken into account and not antigen or other tests, which throw up more false negatives. “We saw that just to bring down the numbers, many districts were doing random mass antigen tests which defeat the purpose. We’ve directed districts to not play around with numbers just to be on a lower level with others,” said an official.Districts have also been asked to make efforts to get 70% of their eligible population vaccinated, especially encourage work place vaccination.Also, to tackle violation of Covid-appropriate behavioural (CAB) norms, flying squads will be sent to places like marriage halls and restaurants.Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state task force on Covid-19, said the revision in guidelines is not surprising. “The five-point formula to unlock is a dynamic process… at the moment, cases are coming down but not fast enough. There is a threat of the Delta-Plus variant,” he said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/maharashtra-level-3-is-now-base-level-no-further-easing-of-curbs/articleshow/83865336.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-581832,resizemode-4,msid-83865336/maha-level-3-is-now-base-level-no-further-easing.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/maharashtra-level-3-is-now-base-level-no-further-easing-of-curbs/articleshow/83865336.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T11:11:44+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>7 months of farm protests: What next?</title><description>The farm protests against the three central farm laws at the Delhi borders completed seven months on June 26. Ever since the farmers reached Singhu and Tikri for protests of the Delhi borders on November 26, 2020, evening, there have been 11 rounds of talks between central ministers and farm groups under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM). The last round of talks was held on January 22, 2021, but it broke after the Centre put forward a proposal that the laws could be held in abeyance for 18 months and a joint committee formed to look into their merits and demerits.Later, given the turn the protest took during the farmers’ tractor parade on January 26, they were suddenly given the epithets of Khalistanis, urban naxals and anti-nationals. Farmers have managed to come out of that and have stoically continued with the protests, but there has been no major action after that.“It is a matter of survival for farmers. These laws are against the interests of farmers, who fear losing their land and whatever minimum support price (MSP) they are getting on a few crops (mainly wheat, paddy). We are here to get the laws repealed and make the government bring an act for legal guarantee of MSP on all crops to all farmers. We are not going back before that despite knowing fully well that we may have to face a lot of onslaught,” said senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal (77).“The BJP is still not tired of testing our patience. After all its tricks failed, it is now resorting to defamation. We will face this as well but will not go away. These laws are against the economy, social life, the soul and spirit of farmers,” claimed BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan (75), who is part of SKM’s nine-member apex committee.These months have also seen farmers of Punjab and Haryana stand by each other. The protests of Punjab based farm groups are being run with the active support of villagers in Haryana. “Going by all this, the Haryana government is now raising the bogey of SYL canal, which directly concerns the farmers from both the states. But farmers will not fall into this trap and many feel it is a dead issue,” said a farm leader.Rakesh Tikait, who has emerged as another big face of the movement, has categorically said that government is not ready to listen. “Get ready with your tractors as the struggle has to be intensified to save our lands. The central government must stop thinking that farmers will go back. Farmers will go back only when their demands are met. Our demands are that the three laws should be repealed and make an act on MSP,” he said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/seven-months-of-farm-protests-farm-unions-grapple-with-risky-decision-of-what-next/articleshow/83865363.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-601766,resizemode-4,msid-83865363/7-months-of-farm-protests-what-next.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/seven-months-of-farm-protests-farm-unions-grapple-with-risky-decision-of-what-next/articleshow/83865363.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-26T11:13:12+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>In a first, drone attack on IAF station</title><description>Two explosives-laden drones crashed into the high-security Indian Air Force station at Jammu airport in the early hours of Sunday, officials said.Two IAF personnel were injured in the explosions that took place around 1.40 am within six minutes of each other.

Investigation is on and further details are awaited".A high-level meeting was underway at the Air Force station with senior police and Indian Air Force officials in attendance, sources said.Various probe teams including that of the IAF and National Investigation Agency reached the Air Force station.Jammu airport is a civil airport with the runway and the ATC (air traffic control) under the IAF.Jammu Airport director Pravat Ranjan Beuria told PTI that there was no disruption in flight operations due to the explosions. "Flights to and from Jammu airport are operating as per schedule," he said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-low-intensity-blasts-at-jammu-air-force-station-use-of-drones-suspected/articleshow/83887833.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-109898,resizemode-4,msid-83887833/in-a-first-drone-attack-on-iaf-station.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/two-low-intensity-blasts-at-jammu-air-force-station-use-of-drones-suspected/articleshow/83887833.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T10:27:55+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Office realty leasing rises 30%, on track to beat last year high</title><description>Mumbai: Robust demand for office spaces has pushed commercial property leasing in the first three quarters of 2019 by 30% from a year ago, taking it closer to entire 2018’s performance and making sure that this year surpasses the peak touched last year.Driven by tech corporates — accounting for about a third of the leasing activity — office space take-up touched 47 million sq ft in the first nine months against entire 2018’s performance of 48.9 million sq ft, showed data from CBRE South Asia. With this, office leasing activity is now expected to touch its highest level ever, estimated to be over 60 million sq ft in 2019.Leasing activity stood at about 15.4 million sq ft during the quarter ended September, rising by nearly 23% on an annual basis. This was dominated by small- to medium-sized transactions. Small-sized transactions of less than 10,000 sq ft accounted for over 40% of the transaction activity in the quarter.

“With office leasing scaling a historic high in 2019, we expect further strengthening of occupier sentiment in the medium to long term, backed by corporates looking to expand or consolidate their operations. Favourable government initiatives, transparency in the real estate sector and the right reforms will improve investor sentiment greatly in the coming quarters,” said Anshuman Magazine, CEO, India, South-east Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE.Like last year, he expects occupiers would put in greater efforts to incorporate flexibility in their portfolios due to changes in the business environment. Occupiers continued to futureproof their portfolios and hedge against future rental escalations by pre-leasing space across various cities.Bengaluru, followed by Hyderabad, dominated large-sized deal closures, while a few large deals were also reported in the NCR and Pune as well. Large-scale deal closures were mostly dominated by tech firms and flexible space operators. Firms belonging to sectors such as research, consulting &amp; analytics, banking, financial services &amp; insurance (BFSI), and engineering &amp; manufacturing also closed large-sized deals.Tech corporates led the office space take-up, followed by research, consulting &amp; analytics companies (19%) and flexible space operators (15%). The rise in the share of flexible space operators (10% in the second quarter of 2019) was primarily a result of their continued expansion across almost all cities.“The share of the tech sector rose from 31% to 40% annually during 2019 year-to-date, which implies that a rise in technology alternatives, insourcing / job preservation in the US and a global slowdown have not had any specific impact on India’s position as a preferred outsourcing destination for both high-skilled and low-skilled tech services, research and development,” said Ram Chandnani, managing director, advisory &amp; transaction services, India, CBRE South Asia.Supply addition rose by more than 80% in 2019 YTD on an annual basis, with about 43.5 million sq. ft. of development completions reported.Four cities — Hyderabad, Bengaluru, NCR and Mumbai — accounted for almost 80% of this supply addition.Compared to the first three quarters in 2018, the share of SEZs in supply dipped from 40% to 27% during 2019 YTD. Supply addition in the quarter also rose by about 6% on a quarterly basis, touching about 15 million sq. ft. More than 70% of this supply was driven by Hyderabad and NCR, followed by Bengaluru.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/office-realty-leasing-rises-30-on-track-to-beat-last-year-high/articleshow/71641557.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-149799,resizemode-4,msid-71641557/office-realty-leasing-rises-30-on-track-to-beat-last-year-high.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/office-realty-leasing-rises-30-on-track-to-beat-last-year-high/articleshow/71641557.cms</guid><pubDate>2019-10-18T08:18:48+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Developers may face liquidity crisis on NBFC woes: Fitch</title><description>MUMBAI: Liquidity risk is increasing for Indian-based real-estate developers, as non-bank financial institutions (NBFI; including housing finance companies) are shying away from lending to the sector, said Fitch Ratings.Developers that rely on refinancing from NBFIs, particularly those with weak financial profiles, will be affected the most should conditions persist. The availability of unencumbered assets among large developers may be of limited use, as NBFIs are looking to shed their already-high exposure to the sector, especially to large borrowers.NBFIs have disproportionately increased their share of real-estate sector credit in the previous few years, owing to heightened risk aversion by banks; banks have been cutting exposure due to their own funding challenges that began in late 2018, which have become more acute in the previous few months; domestic bank exposures fell to 2.3% of loans in the financial year ending March 2019 from 2.8% in 2015-16.NBFIs are now also shying away from refinancing maturing debt of even large, proven developers to limit concentration risk to the sector. This is pushing developers towards alternative funding channels, such as private equity. The availability of such funding could be more limited than the value of maturing debt and may only be available to established developers with sufficient unpledged assets. It would also come at a higher cost. We believe banks may still consider exposure to quality real estate, but overall exposure continues to decline.Developers that are focused on high-end projects may face higher risk, as sales of such projects have slowed in the last two years. We believe these developers would be wary of taking sharp price corrections on unsold inventory to boost sales, except in extreme circumstances, as this could diminish the value of unsold inventory and weaken collateral cover for existing lenders.In addition, any boost in sales would be temporary. Meanwhile, developers with substantial exposure to affordable housing may still benefit from marginal access to lenders in light of healthy pre-sales growth, supported by India's substantial housing deficit and government incentives for buyers via the credit-linked subsidy scheme as well as for developers, including tax deductions and grant of infrastructure status, which entitles companies to some benefits and concessions.The government has announced measures to improve NBFI-sector liquidity, but their efficacy remains to be seen. For example, we believe the government's July 2019 announcement to provide a first-loss guarantee of 10% on securitised assets issued by NBFIs to banks could ease funding pressure for NBFIs in the short term. However, the provision refers only to financially sound issuers and there is a lack of clarity about the duration of the guarantee and the definition of what comprises a 'financially sound' entity. In addition, most of the actions by the authorities to alleviate the liquidity squeeze will benefit the largest and least risky NBFIs and is unlikely to address the pressure on the more property focused players.Defaults by two NBFIs - Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL&amp;FS) in September 2018 and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in June 2019 - have contributed to the sector-wide liquidity squeeze, as investors have become more risk averse. Banks' low appetite for lending to real-estate developers is evidenced by the usually high risk weights attached to such loans. These are due to developers' typically low credit ratings amid high leverage, making exposure to the sector an inefficient use of banks' already-limited capital.Substantial bank recapitalisation to increase lending capacity could benefit NBFIs as well as real-estate developers, subject to the banks' risk appetite. Although a structural improvement in NBFI asset books would take time. Nonetheless, even under better conditions we expect NBFI's to tighten credit standards, with developers facing funding pressure until there is a broader improvement in their operations, with better end-user demand and pricing support. </description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/developers-may-face-liquidity-crisis-on-nbfc-woes-fitch/articleshow/70700244.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-144728,resizemode-4,msid-70700244/developers-may-face-liquidity-crisis-on-nbfc-woes-fitch.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/property-/-cstruction/developers-may-face-liquidity-crisis-on-nbfc-woes-fitch/articleshow/70700244.cms</guid><pubDate>2019-08-16T15:59:50+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Odisha based steel industries face shortage of iron ore</title><description>Steel industries in Odisha have urged the state government to bail them out from the high price of raw materials including iron ore.Iron ore production in Odisha has dropped by over 31 million tonnes from 142 million tonnes in 2019-20 to 111 million tonnes in the 2020-21 financial year, according to official data.Due to less production and increase in exports, the local industries have to pay around Rs 10,000 per tonne of iron ore in comparison to Rs 2,200 per MT in June last year.They claimed that due to an unprecedented increase in the price of the iron ore, many of the units had become unviable or on the verge of closure.Industry bodies like the Orissa Sponge Iron Manufacturers' Association and the Kalinga Nagar Industries Association have already taken up the matter with Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, chief secretary and the Steel and Mines secretary to keep iron ore prices at a reasonable level so that iron and steel industries in the state could survive and make some margin."There should be a hike in the production of iron ore. Secondly, captive miners should not take part in the auction process," Kalinga Nagar Industries Association president P L Kandoi said.He said there should be a special provision for fair price of iron ore for the LTL (less than truckload) buyers so that iron and steel industries in the state can survive and make some margin.Odisha Sponge Iron Manufacturing Association president Yogesh Dalmia also opposed the current auction process, saying that the auction of iron ore by the state-owned OMC should be made on a monthly and not bi-monthly basis.Despite the auction, 80 per cent of the iron ore should be reserved for Odisha-based industries, Dalmia said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/odisha-based-steel-industries-face-shortage-of-iron-ore/articleshow/83890272.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-689002,resizemode-4,msid-83890272/odisha-based-steel-industries-face-shortage-of-iron-ore.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/odisha-based-steel-industries-face-shortage-of-iron-ore/articleshow/83890272.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T13:50:10+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Nissan initiates production ramp-up at Chennai plant to clear backlog, cater to pent up demand</title><description>Japanese carmaker Nissan has initiated a gradual ramp-up of production at its Chennai plant as it looks to cater to the pent up demand for its models across domestic and international markets, according to a top company official.  The Oragadam-based plant, which is owned by Renault Nissan Automotive India Pvt Ltd (RNAIPL), had to temporarily suspend operations from May 26-30 due to the worsening of the COVID-19 situation in Tamil Nadu.  The plant closure came after the company had a prolonged tussle with labour unions who demanded work to be stopped at the company's factory.  The factory recommenced production on May 31. On June 4, the Madras High Court allowed the plant to continue with production while asking the automaker to address issues flagged by the state government on the safety of workmen, vis-a-vis COVID-19.  "After a brief pause due to the challenges posed by the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in India, we have carefully resumed operations and initiated a second shift by ramping up production in a phased and gradual manner," Nissan Motor India Managing Director Rakesh Srivastava told .  As a people-first organisation, the company has taken a host of measures towards employee well-being, while continuing to observe all safety protocols mandated by the government authorities, he added.  Srivastava noted that the situation is still fluid, with production processes, manpower and supply chains taking time to attain normalcy.  "But we are hopeful that the situation in the country will steadily improve so that we may operate at full force and increase volumes of the all-new Magnite, Kicks and Datsun portfolio to meet growing demands in India and our export markets," he added.  On shortage of critical components, Srivastava said, "The semiconductor situation has also improved drastically since it emerged at the start of the year. We, at Nissan, work closely with our global teams, manufacturing plant and channel partners to address such supply chain and production issues."  The company has formed a cross-functional 'Semi-conductor Task Force' that proactively works on anticipating global and local shortages whilst seeking alternative solutions, he added.  "We are confident that our experience has allowed us to manage the COVID-19 wave with more resilience, positivity and innovation to drive our business," Srivastava said.  The first joint Renault-Nissan Alliance plant for global markets, the Chennai facility has a production capacity of 400,000 units per annum. Opened in March 2010, the plant involves an investment of Rs 4,500 crore and employs 1,500 people.  Koleos and Fluence were the first vehicles designed for the Indian market to roll off the production lines.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/nissan-initiates-production-ramp-up-at-chennai-plant-to-clear-backlog-cater-to-pent-up-demand/articleshow/83888278.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-187807,resizemode-4,msid-83888278/nissan-initiates-production-ramp-up-at-chennai-plant-to-clear-backlog-cater-to-pent-up-demand.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/auto/auto-news/nissan-initiates-production-ramp-up-at-chennai-plant-to-clear-backlog-cater-to-pent-up-demand/articleshow/83888278.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T11:08:09+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Will quality stocks rise again as value investing loses steam?</title><description>MUMBAI: Quality stocks have had a poor run as compared to value stocks in the stock market – at home as well as globally. So far in 2021, Nifty500 Value 50 index has trounced the Nifty200 Quality 30 index in terms of absolute returns.As a cyclical recovery took hold at home and globally from September, investors have rapidly switched to value stocks and made astronomical returns in a short span. The Nifty500 Value 50 index is up 41 per cent from September. By comparison, the Nifty200 Quality 30 index has risen merely 9 per cent.Yet, after months of underperformance quality stocks are making a comeback. Over the past month, quality stocks are showing signs of life as the Nifty200 Quality 30 index has returned nearly 5 per cent, outperforming the value factor.“Economically sensitive cyclical stocks have had a very strong run year-to-date. We don’t think their full potential is exhausted, but we do see an opportunity to also turn attention to quality stocks as the cycle’s next beneficiaries,” Blackrock’s Antonio DeSpirito said in a recent blog post.The world’s largest asset manager with over $8 trillion in managed assets believes quality stocks could become the leader of the next leg of the global equity bull market.The reason for Blackrock’s change in view rests on its belief that the global economy is now progressing from an early business cycle to mid-business cycle. With easy returns, such as those seen over the past 14 months, difficult to come by and investors increasingly wary of inflation running hot and central banks tightening leash on liquidity, certainty of earnings and low volatility could become a dominant theme.“We see potential for quality to rerate higher. As the cycle evolves, the market will look ahead to more normalized growth rates, and investors are likely to grow more cautious amid concerns around taxes, inflation and the timing of a Fed policy shift,” DeSpirito said.While Blackrock’s view is largely centered around the US equity market, it can be easily extended to Dalal Street. Back in November, as major global asset managers started talking up cyclical stocks on announcement of COVID-19 vaccine approval, Indian cyclical stocks started seeing strong inflows from foreign portfolio investors. If foreign asset managers rotate funds towards more low volatility and quality stocks going ahead, the trend is likely to replicate in India, said money managers. “Beyond the short-term tactical opportunity, we also see a long-term structural case for maintaining a quality bias,” DeSpirito said.Blackrock said that its analysis showed that quality stocks tended to outperform the broad market in long period and the “only time quality did not maintain its edge was in the early emergence from recession”.“This period also set the stage for an attractive entry point into an investment style that, from here forward, could lend some portfolio resilience as this unusual, and potentially fast-moving, economic and market cycle unfolds,” DeSpirito said.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-quality-stocks-rise-again-as-value-investing-loses-steam/articleshow/83888729.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-98874,resizemode-4,msid-83888729/will-quality-stocks-rise-again-as-value-investing-loses-steam.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/will-quality-stocks-rise-again-as-value-investing-loses-steam/articleshow/83888729.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T11:46:31+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Crypto Week at a Glance: A volatile Bitcoin continues to dictate market trends</title><description>By Analytics Team, Giottus Cryptocurrency ExchangeThe past week has been a volatile one for the crypto market as Bitcoin (BTC) dropped from $36,000 levels to $29,000 mid-week before regaining most of the losses later. BTC was trading at $31,000-32,000 – a key support range that can determine the next few weeks of activity in the cryptocurrency market.Most altcoins followed BTC through the week with no standalone breakout. In this volatile scenario, traders are likely to avoid leveraged positions.BTC dropped below $30,000 mid-week amid concerns with China’s clampdown on BTC mining rigs as well as lack of support from top institutions. JP Morgan strategists believe that overall signals continue to be bearish for BTC. About $6 billion worth of options expired on Friday, triggering an 8 per cent drop in the market overnight.BTC has been exhibiting the Wyckoff pattern since early January and is now possibly entering a growth phase. Breaking out from the $42K barrier will be key for a full-blown bullish divergence. Altcoins can grow disproportionately if that eventuates.In adoption news, Paraguay is set to become the second country to propose a bill to authorize Bitcoin as legal tender after El Salvador. On Friday, El Salvador announced that they would distribute $30 worth of Bitcoins to every adult in the country. BTC will become legal tender in El Salvador on September 7. The country has already seen many developments in the field of cryptocurrency, including 1,500 BTC ATM machines, geothermal BTC mining, and foreign investments in the country.Microstrategy, the largest institutional buyer of BTC, added another $500 million worth BTC to its portfolio earlier in the week.BTC: Technical AnalysisBTC has been creating lows in smaller time frames (&lt;4H) all week and is comfortably in an ascending channel (long term bearish pattern). But on a lower level, it is a descending channel (long term bullish). The coming days will be decisive for BTC to go sideways for a while or continue in a descending channel and then break out of it, resulting in a bullish divergence.      83890046The BTC dominance chart (share of BTC to overall market) has been making a rising wedge recently, which suggests that the dominance may decline significantly in the coming weeks, indicating a strong growth for altcoins.Major levelsSupport: $29,700, $28,500, $27,300, $25,600Resistance: $41,500, $39,800, $36,500, $32,100Crypto prices as of 12.15 hours IST on June 27, 2021 (Source: coinmarketcap.com)Top 5 gainers during the week:INO Coin (INO), 170.25 per centDero (DERO), 78.24Celo (CELO), 77.97 per centConstellation (DAG) 43.47 per centQuant (QNT), 19.75 per centTop 5 losers during the week:Kusama (KSM), 45.23 per centInternet Computer (ICP), 39.96 per centAmp (AMP), 36.6 per centNEAR Protocol (NEAR), 36.44 per centFantom (FTM) 36.05 per cent</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/crypto-week-at-a-glance-a-volatile-bitcoin-continues-to-dictate-market-trends/articleshow/83889972.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-56990,resizemode-4,msid-83889972/crypto-week-at-a-glance-a-volatile-bitcoin-continues-to-dictate-market-trends.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/crypto-week-at-a-glance-a-volatile-bitcoin-continues-to-dictate-market-trends/articleshow/83889972.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-27T13:27:33+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Apple faces Indian engineer’s bias lawsuit</title><description>Apple Inc. lost an early round in a discrimination lawsuit brought in the U.S. by a female engineer from India who says her two managers -- one from her country, the other from Pakistan -- treated her as they would in their own countries: as a subservient.The woman’s case in California state court is the latest to allege workplace bias in Silicon Valley that focuses on cultural prejudices of some tech workers from South Asia. Cisco Systems Inc. is fighting a suit brought by California’s civil rights agency alleging bias against a member of India’s so-called lower castes, known as Dalits.Anita Nariani Schulze is part of the Sindhi minority -- she is Hindu, with ancestry in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan. Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticized her, micromanaged her work, and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.Schulze claims the managers’ animus reflects sexism, racism, religious bias and discrimination on the basis of national origin. The Sindhi Hindu nationality is “known for its technical acumen” and its gender equality, she says, which “exacerbated the managers’ discriminatory treatment.”In a tentative ruling on Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni rejected Apple’s request to toss out the suit. While not ruling on the merits of the case, Kulkarni said Schulze had adequately supported her legal claims. Apple had argued her claims weren’t specific enough and were based on stereotypes.But the judge rejected Schulze’s request to represent a class of female Apple employees who suffered job discrimination over the last four years. He agreed with Apple that she didn’t show a pattern of discrimination that could be applied to a broader group.It wasn’t clear from the court’s docket whether the judge will hold a hearing Thursday before issuing a final ruling.Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.In the Cisco case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged that two Indian employees at the San Jose-based company discriminated against a Dalit co-worker on the basis of caste.Cisco has denied the claims, insisting it has “zero tolerance for discrimination.” It also said the lawsuit should be tossed out because caste isn’t a protected category under U.S. civil rights law.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/apple-faces-indian-engineers-bias-lawsuit/articleshow/81694292.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-845744,resizemode-4,msid-81694292/apple-faces-indian-engineers-bias-lawsuit.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/apple-faces-indian-engineers-bias-lawsuit/articleshow/81694292.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-03-25T23:14:01+05:30</pubDate></item><item><title>Ravi Shankar Prasad questions Arnab Goswami's arrest</title><description>NEW DELHI: Law Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday described the arrest of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami as "seriously reprehensible, unwarranted and worrisome."He also questioned the silence of the Congress leadership when its government in Maharashtra was "blatantly suppressing freedom of press."Police on Wednesday arrested Goswami in Mumbai for allegedly abetting suicide of a 53-year-old interior designer, a police official said."The arrest of senior journalist Arnab Goswami is seriously reprehensible, unwarranted and worrisome.

The report, titled 'Payroll Reporting in India: An Employment Perspective - April 2021', said that since the number of subscribers is from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive. Further, the report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level, it further said.As per the report, 9,283 central government employees joined NPS in April while 33,458 state government employees enrolled for the scheme and 13,103 corporate sector employees joined in April.Of the 1.04 million subscribers added under ESIC, 0.83 million were men and 0.21 were women workers. Further, out of the 1.27 million net subscribers added during the month, around 0.68 million new members have come into the social security coverage of EPFO for the first time while 5.86 lakh net subscribers exited and then rejoined EPFO by changing their jobs.Mospi has been bringing out the employment related statistics in the formal sector covering the period September 2017 onwards, using information on the number of subscribers who have subscribed under three major schemes, namely the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme, the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) Scheme and the National Pension Scheme (NPS).While EPF is applicable to establishments having more than 20 workers earning wages up to Rs 15,000 a month, ESIC applies to firms and establishments with 10 or more employees with wages up to Rs 21,000 a month.</description><link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/epfo-adds-1-27-million-subscribers-in-april/articleshow/83844142.cms</link><image>https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-310,imgsize-676488,resizemode-4,msid-83844142/epfo-adds-1-27-million-subscribers-in-april.jpg</image><guid>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/epfo-adds-1-27-million-subscribers-in-april/articleshow/83844142.cms</guid><pubDate>2021-06-25T20:38:12+05:30</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
