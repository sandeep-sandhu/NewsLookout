[installation]
# this section lists the file and directory locations

# A common variable can be re-used in subsequent variables
# Here, the installation directory is specified as the 'prefix' variable:
prefix = /usr/local/share/NewsLookout

# The configuration directory si specified relative to the prefix director
# However, an absolute path could also be given:
conf_dir = %(prefix)s/conf

# The data_dir contains the name of the data directory where the data files will be saved:
data_dir = /var/cache/web_scraped_data

# location of the log file, here it is specified relative to the data directory:
log_file = %(data_dir)s/logs/newslookout.log

# location of the plugins directory
plugins_dir = %(prefix)s/plugins
plugins_contributed_dir = %(prefix)s\plugins_contrib

# if a pid file exists, the applicaiton will not launch
# this is to prevent multiple instances launched on the same machine
# as part of proper shutdown sequence, the pid file will be automatically deleted

[operation]

# fixed time is added to the random time to determine the total wait time
# between two web fetches to the same URL
